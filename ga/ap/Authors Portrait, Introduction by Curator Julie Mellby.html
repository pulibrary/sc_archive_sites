       <p align="justify" class="style22">&ldquo;We expect a lot of portraits,&rdquo; writes Tom Hare, the William Sauter  LaPorte &rsquo;28 Professor in Regional Studies and Professor of Comparative  Literature at Princeton. &ldquo;A good likeness seems essential, but not sufficient,  because the likeness should show us something about the person that goes beyond  the superficiality of appearance.&rdquo; Beginning January 22, 2010, visitors to  Firestone Library&rsquo;s Main Gallery will have the opportunity to look for that  &ldquo;something&rdquo; in more than 100 portraits of poets, novelists, and essayists,  pulled from the holdings of the Department of Rare Books and Special  Collections for the exhibition &ldquo;The Author&rsquo;s Portrait: &lsquo;O, Could He But Have  Drawne His Wit.&rsquo;&rdquo; Paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, marble sculptures,  and plaster death masks, dating from 1489 to 1989, will be on view. Among the  writers featured are William Shakespeare, Virgil, George Sand, Rudyard Kipling,  George Bernard Shaw, and Sojourner Truth, and the artists include William  Blake, Constantin Brancusi, Jean-Antoine Houdon, Willem de Passe, and Auguste  Rodin. The exhibition continues through July 5, 2010.</p>
       <p align="justify" class="style22">Many of the portraits stem from friendships that were formed or  flourished over long afternoons of conversation between artist and sitter, such  as &Eacute;douard Manet and Charles Baudelaire, William Hogarth and Henry Fielding,  Lucas Cranach the Elder and Martin Luther, and Ilia Efimovich Repin and Leo  Tolstoy. Animosities also developed, such as that between the artist William  Marshall and the poet John Milton, who famously told his readers (writing in  Greek so the artist could not understand) to &ldquo;laugh at the botching artist&rsquo;s  mis-attempt.&rdquo; Charles Dickens had Daniel Maclise throw out all his early  sketches and begin again from scratch. Lord Byron was unhappy with most of the  published images of himself, writing that &ldquo;the frontispiece of an author&rsquo;s  visage is but a paltry exhibition.&rdquo; Poet William Cowper reported, &ldquo;I have now  been sufficiently copied, and hope to have nothing more to do with painters.&rdquo;  William Blake&rsquo;s first attempt at a posthumous frontispiece portrait of Cowper  filled Lady Hesketh, Cowper&rsquo;s cousin, &ldquo;with a degree of horror which I shall  not recover from in haste . . . and I intreat you on my knees not to suffer so  horrible a representation . . . to be presented to the publick.&rdquo; Still other  authors sought to control the images of themselves. An ailing John Donne  devised his own memorial portrait by posing for a likeness shortly before his  death. The author brought a winding sheet to the artist&rsquo;s studio, undressed,  and wrapped himself for burial.</p>
       <p align="justify" class="style22">The subtitle of the exhibition is from Ben Jonson&rsquo;s poem concerning the  famous portrait of Shakespeare engraved for the First Folio (1623) and  attributed to Martin Droeshout the Younger. In the introduction to the  annotated checklist of the exhibition, Professor Hare finds that Jonson&rsquo;s &ldquo;speculation  that the portrait would have &lsquo;surpasse[d] All, that was ever writt in Brasse,&rsquo;  had Droeshout managed to draw Shakespeare&rsquo;s wit instead of merely his face,  suggests a broader statement about the powers of portraiture versus the powers  of poetry.&rdquo; </p>
       <p align="justify" class="style22">Dr. Gwendolyn DuBois Shaw, associate professor of American art and  director of the Program in Visual Studies at the University of Pennsylvania,  will contribute to that discussion at the exhibition&rsquo;s opening on Sunday,  January 24. Her lecture, &ldquo;The Ideal Pencil: Poetry, Portraiture, and  Prejudice,&rdquo; will focus on African American writer Phillis Wheatley and  portraits of African American women writers in the 19th century. The portrait  of Wheatley by Scipio Moorhead, an enslaved African American artist, inspired  her to write &ldquo;To S. M. a Young African Painter, On Seeing His Works,&rdquo; which  begins:</p>
       <p align="justify" class="style22">To show the lab&rsquo;ring bosom&rsquo;s deep intent,<br />
         And thought in living characters to paint,<br />
         When first thy pencil did those beauties give,<br />
         And breathing figures learnt from thee to live,<br />
         How did those prospects give my soul delight,<br />
         A new creation rushing on my sight?<br />
         Still, wond&rsquo;rous youth! each noble path pursue,<br />
         On deathless glories fix thine ardent view:<br />
         Still may the painter&rsquo;s and the poet&rsquo;s fire<br />
         To aid thy pencil, and thy verite conspire! </p>
