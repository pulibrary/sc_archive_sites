          <p><strong>Unseen Hands: Women Printers</strong>            <strong>Binders and Book Designers</strong></p>
          <p>Women have been involved in printing and the making of books ever
            since these crafts were first developed. Even before the advent of
            movable type, there was a strong tradition of women producing manuscripts
            in western European religious houses. In the Convent of San Jacopo
            di Ripoli in Florence, we find the first documented evidence, in
            1476, of women working as printers. Girls and women were often trained
            by
            their fathers or husbands to assist in printing businesses, and there
            are many instances from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries
            of women taking over and managing these enterprises upon the early
            demise
            of their male relatives. We may be sure that women played many different
            roles in these situations, although what exactly is not always easy
            to verify. Many, certainly, only managed the business, while others
            were more directly involved. Estellina, wife of the printer Abraham
            Conant, proudly stated in a Hebrew book, Behinat `olam (Mantua, ca.
          1477) that &#8220;she, together with one man, did the typesetting.&#8221;</p>
          <p>
            By the nineteenth century, in both Europe and the United States,
            male-only unions ruled the printing business. Women, where employed
            at all, were
            relegated to certain low-paying jobs considered best suited for the
            weaker sex, such as dressing (polishing imperfections) from metal
            type, folding printed sheets, and sewing bindings. Yet there were
            exceptions.
            Emily Faithfull, for example, founded the Victoria Press in London
            specifically to teach women the trade. Agnes Peterson established
            the Women's Co-Operative Printing Union in San Francisco in 1868.
            Augusta
            Lewis Troup, journalist and typesetter for Susan B. Anthony&#8217;s
            newspaper The Revolution, was elected corresponding secretary of
            the International Typographical Union in 1870, the first woman to
            hold
            any national union office. Women were notably successful at bookbinding,
            both &#8220;on the line&#8221;-- producing factory bindings -- and
            in the creation of splendid examples of hand binding, particularly
            during the Arts and Crafts Revival of the late nineteenth and early
            twentieth centuries. This same period also witnessed a renewed interest
            in fine printing, and women such as Virginia Woolf and Elizabeth
            Yeats founded private presses that produced handsome limited editions
            of
          the work of contemporary authors and artists.</p>
          <p>            Since the mid-twentieth century, women have moved into
            every job in commercial printing, from running the paper (Katherine
            Graham)
            to running
            the press. Examples of the fine printing of Bertha Goudy and Jane
            Grabhorn also grace this exhibition, along with the work of such
            notable designers
            and illustrators as Elizabeth Shippen Green, Clare Leighton, and
            Elizabeth Friedlander. This exhibition represents only one contribution
            toward
            a full history of the roles of women in printing and the arts of
            the book. Much remains to be discovered, documented, and written,
            though
            it is likely that many women -- particularly those outside the mainstream
            -- will remain forever unknown and &#8220;unseen.&#8221; Each woman
            featured in this exhibition stands in for thousands of her sisters,
            known
            and unknown, who have loved books and printing, and gotten on with
            the
            work.<br>
