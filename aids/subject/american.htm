<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">Sermons in the Manuscripts

collections, in scrapbooks and among General Manuscripts
(Miscellaneous). Most original material is by Princeton
University affiliated clergymen.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">The Stewart M. Robinson
Collection of Colonial Sermons contains copies of published and
unpublished material dating back to 1615. Several collections of
family papers, including William Tennent (1740-1777) of New
Jersey and South Carolina, and Henry Van Dyke (1852-1933), pastor
of the First Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn, also provide
examples. Sermons dating from the 19th century are to be found
among the papers of Princeton graduates such as Charles Woodruff
Shields (1825-1904) and Eli Field Cooley (1781-1860), and of John
T. Duffield, Princeton math professor from 1849-1898. The
scrapbooks of David Laurence Pierson (1865-1938) also contain
examples. Sermons from the 20th century are in the papers of
Walter Lowrie (1868-1959) and Paul Martin (1862-1956). </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">There are over 100
collections containing diaries and journals in the Manuscripts
Division, many of them with religious content. Some of the most
important are to be found in family papers of the Howells of
Morris County, N.J. (1715-1958), and Martines and Dyckmans of
Westchester and Dutchess Counties, N.Y. (1782-1906). A small
number of journals kept by local women are to be found among
General Manuscripts (Bound). Many record the chapter and verse of
lessons and accompanying sermons from church services attended.
The collections also include two journals of English evangelical
minister John Newton (1725-1807), author of the words to
&quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">Tennent sermons in General
Manuscripts (Bound), documenting the schism in the Presbyterian
Church under the impact of the Great Awakening and the influence
of the &quot;Log College&quot; on the founding of the university.
Holdings for Presidents Aaron Burr (1716-1757), Jonathan Edwards
(1703-1758) and John Witherspoon (1723-1794) further document
these developments. The papers of Samuel Miller (1782-1848) and
Charles Hodge (1797-1878), who both taught at the Princeton
Theological Seminary and served on the university's board of
trustees, document relations between the two institutions. The
Princeton faculty, scientists as well as humanists, embraced the
notion of theistic evolution during the Darwinist controversy of
the late 19th century (1875 and after). The Manuscripts Division
has papers of representative figures in this debate such as
biologist George Macloskie (1834-1920) and philosopher Charles
Woodruff Shields (1823-1904). It also contains the papers of
Lucius Hopkins Miller (1876-1949), the university's first English
Bible professor, and George F. Thomas (1899- ), hired as the
first professor of religious thought in 1940, four years prior to
the founding of the Department of Religion. Holdings at Mudd
Library and in the Manuscripts Division for presidents James
McCosh (1811-1894), Francis Landey Patton (1843-1932), Woodrow
Wilson (1856-1924) and John Grier Hibben (1861-1933) reflect the
changing role of religion in the curriculum. There are also the
papers of Walter Lowrie (1868-1959), Episcopal clergyman and
principal translator of Soren Kierkegaard, and Paul Martin
(1862-1956), who engaged in the fundamentalist controversy of the
1920s. The diaries of Smith Ordway (1880-84) document the role of
religion in student life. There are also numerous sermons,
lectures, and notes in General Manuscripts (Bound) by Princeton
trustees, professors, and their students on the Bible, church
history, and theology.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">In addition, the University
Archives holds records of more than 25 student religious
organizations beginning at about the middle of the 19th-century,
most notably a large collection of materials on the Philadelphian
Society and its successors, the Student-Faculty Association and
the Student Christian Association. The Archives also holds the
records of the University Chapel (1928- ). </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">Among the Collection of
American Architectural Drawings are the drawings of C. Grant La
Farge, an American architect, including his plans for the
cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City and St.
Matthew's Cathedral in Washington D.C. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">There are copies of
illustrations (1857) of early Catholic missions in California in
the collection of Sheldon Jackson (1834-1909), a missionary who
worked with Indians in the West. The Manuscripts Division also
contains journals, notes and letters of 4 Presbyterian
missionaries with the Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian
Church. They are Grace Newton (1860-1915), Jonathan Pennington
Alward (1812-1841), W. Scott Watson (1862-1944), and William
McElwee Miller (1892- ) who went to China, West Africa, Syria and
Iran respectively.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">The Mudd Library holds the
records of United Service to China, an umbrella organization for
a number of mission-related societies in China that coordinated
Chinese relief efforts during the 1940-1950 period. The
University Archives also holds the records of Princeton-in-Asia
and its predecessor organizations, the Princeton-Yenching
Foundation and Princeton-in-Peking, which began as a missionary
effort of the Philadelphia Society.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">The Mormon Collections at
Princeton are among the most comprehensive outside Utah.
Manuscript materials range from significant single items (such as
a letter of 1846 written in Brigham Young's hand during the trek
West) to a collection of modern typescripts of 19th-century
manuscripts (created for Herbert Auerbach). Imprints cover the
range of Mormon history from 1830 to the present, but the
materials in this department are especially rich in ephemeral
publications from the first century of Mormonism. The collections
are also notable for Utah territorial imprints, 19th-century
photographs and other graphic depictions of Utah and the Mormons.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10"><b><u>American Indian
Religions</u></b></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">The American Indian materials
in the Western Americana collections are especially strong and
include much on American Indian religions. The archive of the
Association of American Indian Affairs documents much activity
focused on guaranteeing the freedom of religion among indigenous
American tribes. The Papers of Oliver La Farge touch on the same
issues. Several manuscript collections document the crusade for
the restoration of Blue Lake to Taos Pueblo based on its
religious significance (The Papers of Rufus Poole, William
Schaab, Corinne Locker and Bobby Kilberg). The Papers of
Hildegard Forbes, the Papers of Henry S. Forbes (Special File on
Alaska) and the Papers of Alden Stevens all contain material of
interest to scholars in this field. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier 10">The ACLU Archives contain
some of the most extensive holdings available on the questions of
the free exercise of religion and the separation of church and
state. Of note are the Scopes Trial (1925-1927), Jehovah's
Witnesses cases (1938-1955), Bible reading and school prayer
cases, the Everson case (1947), blue law cases, and scientific
creationism cases from the 1980s. Papers of Justice John Marshall
Harlan, Roger Baldwin, Arthur Garfield Hays, Edward S. Corwin and
Alpheus Mason, the archives of Common Cause and an oral history
with William O. Douglas also document the question of the
constitutional status of religion in the United States.</font></p>
