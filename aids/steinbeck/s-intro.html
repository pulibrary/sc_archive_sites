PREFACE
</FONT>
<P>BACKGROUND TO THE DONATION

<P>In forming this comprehensive collection of John Steinbeck, Preston
Beyer always had in mind that its ultimate home would be the library of
a major research university.&nbsp; Since Steinbeck’s legacy would be best
understood within the broad context of American twentieth century literature,
placing the collection where there were complementary collections of American
literature became a decisive factor in choosing Princeton.&nbsp; The path
to this donation was a bit surprising, however.

<P>It started at an academic conference with a casual conversation between
Columbia professor Lynne Sagalyn and Princeton professor Jim Doig.&nbsp;
Professor Sagalyn had taken the lead in exploring the question of where
her father’s collection should be permanently placed.&nbsp; Her father
was a Cornell man (class of 1934), and he had already given Cornell one
Steinbeck collection.&nbsp; But being an indefatigable collector, he had
another collection, and he was looking for a home for it.&nbsp; Professor
Doig suggested offering it to Princeton since American literature is one
of the strengths of the Library’s special collections.

<P>Professor Sagalyn contacted Associate University Librarian for Rare
Books and Special Collections, William Joyce, and after several rounds
of conversation, she and her sisters decided to donate the Collection.

<P>The Collection, consisting of about 1500 books and numerous boxes of
pamphlets, clippings, issues of magazines, as well as correspondence, was
formally received by the Library in April 1994.&nbsp; The exhibition opening
on January 1995 honored the donation as the largest single-author collection
to be given to the Library in recent years.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>SCOPE OF THE CATALOGUE

<P>Entries in this catalogue cover the totality of the Preston Beyer Collection
at the time of donation as well as some additions made during the calendar
year 1995.

<P>The catalogue falls into three major sections:

<P>&middot; books and other writings by John Steinbeck
<BR>&middot; printed materials about or related to John Steinbeck
<BR>&middot; manuscripts — including both originals by John Steinbeck as
well as extensive materials in manuscript relating to John Steinbeck.

<P>The foreword by Mr. Beyer lays out with great charm the whole process
by which he gathered the collection and its companion now at Cornell.

<P>In the process of compiling the catalogue we discovered some new facts
about the publishing history of John Steinbeck’s writings.&nbsp; One such
discovery has to do with his Letters to Alicia.&nbsp; Mr. Beyer went to
great pains to collect the full series of letters first published in the
newspaper Long Island Newsday.&nbsp; When comparing the Beyer holdings
against the official listing of the series in the 1974 bibliography of
John Steinbeck prepared by Adrian Goldstone and John Payne, we discovered
several misprinted lines in Goldstone and Payne.&nbsp; That misprint leaves
out several letters in the series.&nbsp; A full correct listing can be
found in this catalog.&nbsp; We also discovered that no one has yet issued
a collected edition of Steinbeck’s Letters to Alicia, even though a number
of his other writings, both formal and informal, have been comprehensively
collected and published.&nbsp; Clearly, the Beyer collection of the Letters
presents an opportunity for the compilation of such a collected edition.

<P>ARRANGEMENT OF ENTRIES

<P>The basis for this catalogue is that compiled by Preston Beyer over
a number of years.&nbsp; The Beyer catalogue provided the basic structure
for what you now have before you.&nbsp; The level of detail that Mr. Beyer
included is preserved as well.&nbsp; Also, all notes about a particular
piece in the collection derive directly from the Beyer catalogue.&nbsp;
For example, in the second major section (About John Steinbeck), all such
notations as “JS mentioned p[age] ...” are Mr. Beyer’s notes.

<P>To some extent, this catalogue is&nbsp; based on the 1980 effort of
Bradford Morrow, bookseller of Santa Barbara, California.&nbsp; Mr. Morrow’s
Catalogue Eight, John Steinbeck A Collection of Books &amp; Manuscripts.&nbsp;
The Harry Valentine Collection is a model of clarity of presentation as
well as being remarkable in detail.

<P>The arrangement of&nbsp; entries falls into three major sections, with
further subdivision within each of those sections.

<P>First, all printed material is divided from manuscript and then, the
rubric of printed material was divided into two parts:&nbsp; the writings
of Steinbeck were separated from everything else relating to him.&nbsp;
Works by Steinbeck are arranged&nbsp; according to form of publication:
books and pamphlets; contributions to books; articles and such like in
periodicals.&nbsp; Then within each subdivision, the items are usually
arranged by date of publication, so to mark the growth of these publications
through the life of the author down to the present.

<P>Material about or relating to John Steinbeck varies in form and content.&nbsp;
Arrangement&nbsp; and sub-arrangement of this material is based on categories
reflecting these varying forms. Here too the principle of chronological
sub-arrangement was adopted, so to demonstrate the rising interest in Steinbeck
as his career progressed as well as his strengthening influence on American
and world culture.

<P>The many boxes of manuscripts fall into two main groups:&nbsp; 1) originals
by John Steinbeck,&nbsp; such as letters, drafts, etc.; and 2) original
materials relating to John Steinbeck, such as the nearly half-century of
correspondence between Mr. Beyer and many bibliographers, critics, collectors,
biographies, librarians, friends and others concerned with the life and
writings of John Steinbeck.

<P>Just as this descriptive catalogue of the Beyer collection separates
printed material from manuscript, so too does the Library assign care.&nbsp;
The manuscripts are held by the Manuscript Division of the Department of
Rare Books and Special Collections and is assigned collection number C0768.&nbsp;
The printed books and like materials are held by the Rare Books Division
of the Department.

<P>Staff in the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at the
Library prepared this catalogue under the general supervision of Stephen
Ferguson, Assistant University Librarian for Rare Books and Special Collections
and Curator of Rare Books.&nbsp; Lynne Sagalyn reviewed the preface and
other details of&nbsp; this publication on behalf of the family.
