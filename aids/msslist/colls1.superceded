affairs of running a country from day to day--reports on railroads, executions,

collecting taxes, paying bills, prisoners, public works, etc. Many of these

departments. Of the few degrees awarded by the first departments with doctoral

programs, only about half are preserved in the Archives. Because President

McCosh supported the creation of a school of science, it is not surprising

that a slight majority of the degrees awarded during his tenure (through

1888) were in the sciences. The modern dissertations represent 45 graduate

departments and tend to be substantially lengthier than the earlier papers.

The bulk of the collection dates from the 1950s and later; the 1980s require
