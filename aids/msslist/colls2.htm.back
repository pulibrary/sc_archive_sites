Mortimer Collection</a>

"Jimmy" Sheean, and Nancy Mitford. In their letters, Kenneth Clark and
Bernard Berenson comment about art, art connoisseurs, and literary figures.
The correspondence is filled not only with literary allusions and criticism

with which Mortimer was held professionally by his correspondents. Noteworthy
too is the affection and warmth for him as a friend that one finds in the
letters, many of which, such as Rebecca West's, are filled with references
to family matters.

Duncan Grant, Monroe Wheeler, and others. There are also three letters
