See: Minutes of the Trustees of the College of New Jersey, vol. 5, p. 249 (Princeton University Archives, Mudd Library) //
Meeting on 18 December 1872.  //
In the President’s report the following re the Trendelenberg Collection  //
“The Committee of the Trustees have, on the recommendation of the Faculty, instructed me [i.e. President James McCosh] to purchase the valuable library of the late Dr. Trendelenburg of Berlin consisting of about 12,000 volumes offered at 6,000 thaler, a little more above $5,000.  These volumes will soon be forwarded and will help to fill the alcoves of our new Library.  I ask the Trustees to advance the money out of the Elizabeth Foundation.”
<br>
Librarian Frederic Vinton’s memorandum book  has this entry for 1873:
<br>October 20th The library was first opened to the students-for purposes of study, between 10 and 11 o’clock, A.M. and between 3 and 4 o’clock, in the afternoon. The Trendelenberg library having been roughly arranged by my son, its examination by myself was commenced today. The immediate objects, however, are merely to enable the treasurer to report on its value, and me to select books for location with the rest of the library on the lower floor.
<br>
December 1st The first examination of the Trendelenberg collection has been completed, the Greek and Roman classics, several hundred in number, separated from the rest, and much of the remainder grouped according to
</p>

<p>Vinton's annual reports in bound codex. Covers 1873-1889.<br>
  Mudd Library<br>
  Princeton University Archives.</p>
<p><br>
  p. 1: &quot;Library of the College of New Jersey, August 18th 1873. Arrived
  in Princeton, today, and immediately commenced inquires preliminary to the removal
  of the library from its old quarters to its new lodgement. ...</p>
<p>Vinton estimates (p.2) that CNJ library at about 20,000 vol at this time. One
  of this jobs was to process the TRENDELENBERG collection which was on the order
  of 9,000 to 10,000 volumes.</p>
<p>See Richardson's 1916 PUL book for details on Trendelenberg. P. 22: &quot;Prof.
  Adolf Trendelenberg, the metaphysical philosopher of Berlin, ... It includes
  185 volumes of old editions of Aristotle and his commentaries, with a hundred
  modern essays in Latin on his philosophy; several hundred volumes of classics
  comparatively rare, and a large body of miscellaneous books. ....&quot;</p>

  documents, almost all relating to the College, were received from Moses Taylor
  Pyne '77 and J. Bayard Henry '76. Also, by 1894 Junius S. Morgan '88 had given
  various early editions of the classics...&quot;</p>
<p>1896</p>
<p>Coleman (36): Junius S. Morgan '88 gave the library the Vergils and other early
  editions of the classics. &quot;Mr. Morgan, who was the Associate Librarian
  from 1898 until 1909, continued to present early editions of the classics and
  other works to the Library until shortly before his death in 1932.&quot;</p>

  volumes.</p>
<p>1910-1911:</p>
<p>No detail about accessions.<br>
  Note p.[2]: The disproportion between the large sums provided for building with
  the similar sums talked of for instructors, and the relatively petty sums, seriously
  wanted for definite pressing needs in the manner of books, is bewildering to
  the professors and a challenge to scoffers in other in other institutions attempting
  like work to ours.</p>
<p>Aug 1, 1911-July 1, 1912:</p>
<p>The accessions numbered 14,676, of which 12,067 were bound volumes, 7,133 were
  acquired by purchase, 4,934 by gift. The most noteworthy gift was five Vespucci
  items from the Hoe sale, given by Cyrus H. McCormick '79, and among these the
  only American copy, out of only four existing copies, of the book which gave
  the name America to this continent. The additions to the Patterson Collection
  contain also items of unusual rarity and interest.</p>
<p>August 1, 1912-July 13, 1913</p>
<p>The gifts and deposits have been unusually noteworthy. They include additional
  volumes for the Vespucci Collection from Cyrus H. McCormick '79; the Laurence
  Hutton collection of association books and pictures; the gift of Mr. R.W. Meirs
  '88, of 533 volumes, with a deposit collection of more than 400 volumes, 125
  autographs, original drawings, etc., by Cruikshank, making a unique working
  collection; a collection of 623 cuneiform tablets from Messrs. R. Br&#129;nnow,

  Moore '83, and others; a collection of 35 cuneiform tablets from Messrs. W.J.
  Funl '09 and G.W. Gilmore '83. The additions to the R.W. Patterson '76, Horace
  Collection have also been of unusual significance and include the first English
  translation, two manuscripts of Horace and one of Virgil, and five Horaces from
  Robert Browning's library.</p>
<p>Other gifts include: a collection of photographs of Phillipine life from Mrs.
  Woodrow Wilson; a collection of Cruikshank illustrations presented by Alexander
  Van Rensselaer '71.</p>
<p>1913-1914:</p>
<p>no specifics</p>
<p>1914-1915:</p>
<p>no specifics</p>
<p>August 1, 1915-July 31 1916:</p>
<p> Noteworthy gifts include preeminently the remarkable collection of Cruikshankiana
  given by Richard Waln Meirs '88 and containing 1,589 numbers, including broadsides,
  drawings, etc. Two European War Collections - one of war posters by John W.
  Garrett '95, and one of war relics by Richard Ridgeley Lytle '13 - have attracted
  much interest. There were gifts of some special importance also from Pliny Fisk
  '81, and Allan Marquand '74, and the additions to the R.W. Patterson Collection
  maintained their customary distinction.<br>
  Coleman (37): Laurence Hutton's library arrives</p>
<p>August 1, 1916-July 31 1917:</p>
<p>Noteworthy gifts include several lots of war posters, books and medals sent
  by J.W. Garrett '95, S.R. Taber '83, Clifford N. Carver '13, and J.S. Morgan
  '88. The Philadelphian Society also has turned over their books.</p>
<p>August 1, 1917-July 31, 1918:</p>
<p>Special attention is called to the Benjamin Strong Collections of war posters,
  war currency, and bound newspaper clippings, including 1,403 items. The extensive
  literature of the Liberty Loans, also given by Mr. Strong, is not yet organized
  for report. Mr. Strong is adding to all these collections, with special attention
  to books and pamphlets on the economic aspects of the war. The Pitney fund for
  books on the war, with some special reference to the books on International
  Law aspects, has been peculiarly useful.</p>
<p>August 1, 1918-July 31, 1919:</p>
<p>The most important acquisitions are, the Magie, Br&#129;nnow, and Paton libraries,
  the Frothingham Collection of Revolutionary Communism, the items from the American
  Commission to Negotiate Peace at Paris, several rare books of importance from
  Messrs. McCormick, Patterson, and Coles, a choice collection of English translations
  of the classics from the library of Gustav Schirmer by Mrs. Schirmer, Dr. Robertson's
  collection of European War Relics in memory of his son Malcolm '15, additions
  to the Benjamin F. Strong special war collections and large additions by Mr.
  Strong and Mr. J.O.H. Pitney to the war books. The Magie library is the law
  library to the late Chancellor Magie, presented by Dean Magie and his sister
  Miss Henrietta Oakley Magie.</p>
<p>1919-1920:</p>
<p>no specifics</p>
<p>August 1, 1920-July 31, 1921:</p>
<p>Through the interest and agency of Professor Harper, the Library has received
  as a deposit the collection od Wordsworthiana made by Mrs. Cynthia Morgan Saint
  John of Ithaca, New York. This collection consists of over one thousand books
  and periodicals representing practically all editions, both English and American,
  of Wordsworth's works. It includes many manuscripts, letters. photographs, and
  paintings, first editions and copies owned and read by the poet. It is the largest
  of its kind, with the exception of that at Dove Cottage, Grassmere. It is hoped
  that funds can be raised for the purchase of this very valuable collection.</p>
<p>1921-1922:</p>
<p>no specifics</p>
<p>August 1, 1922-July 31, 1923:</p>
<p>Among the most notable gifts of the year is the collection of books on the
  French Revolution, made by the late W.D. Weaver, and given to the University
  by James W. McGraw. This collection, numbering 2,141 volumes and several hundred
  pamphlets, is of great value, including as it does many works which are very
  rare and are not to be found even in the President White Collection at Cornell
  University.</p>
<p>The bequest of the late Alexander Horton Travis '84, enriched the Library by
  the addition of several hundred volumes of the classics of English and American
  literature, all in editions that are a pleasure to handle and to use. This gift
  has enabled us to discard many badly printed and outworn volumes that were a
  discouragement rather than an incentive to reading.</p>
<p>Mr. Benjamin Strong has supplemented his former gifts by funds which have permitted
  us to place commissions in the hands of foreign booksellers for purchase of
  the original sources for the study of present day public finance.</p>
<p>To the generosity of Mr. Rodman Wanamaker '86, we owe the collection of books
  and pamphlets relating to the European War, made by Herbert Adams Gibbons, and
  a collection of 28 medals struck to commemorate the various Presidents of the
  United States.</p>
<p>August 1, 1923-July 31, 1924:</p>
<p>To the Class of '84, we are indebted also for a most interesting collection
  of autographs, together with the sum of $100, to be applied to their permanent
  installment; for a miniature of Dolly Madison; and for the original box in which
  the repeal of the Stamp Act was sent to America.</p>
<p>We are indebted to Mrs. Adrian H. Joline for one of the most valuable and interesting
  gifts this year, a collection comprising a Tibetan manuscript on Buddhist mysticism,
  a Persian illuminated manuscript, a manuscript copy of the Koran which was captured
  at the time of the relief of Lucknow in 1858 by Lt. Gen. Sir Edward Lugard,
  K.C.B. and three printed volumes distinguished for their bindings.</p>
<p>August 1, 1924-July 31, 1925:</p>
<p>The first of the larger collections to be received was the private library
  of George H. Boker, of the Class of 1842. ...friend of Leland, of Bayard Taylor
  and of most of the group who, during the second half of the nineteenth century,
  created an American literature. ... many first editions of American authors,
  inscribed as presentations copies...</p>
<p>The LeBrun Collections of Montaigne and Rabelais, comprising 367 volumes, is
  of very great value; containing, as it does, all of the 16th century editions
  of Montaigne and most of the significant and scholarly editions, published at
  later dates, of both authors; and a wealth of critical material that it would
  be difficult, if not impossible, now to assemble. It is emphatically a scholar's
  collection.</p>
<p>The Woodrow Wilson Collection...is an almost complete collection of the original
  prints of the writings of President Wilson, as well as of the books published,
  both in this country and abroad, which contain specific estimates of his life
  and work. The obituary notices, appearing in the press during the months following
  his death, for which the Board of Trustees made a special appropriation, have
  been bound in 15 large folio volumes and are of unique interest. Through the
  courtesy of the Department od State, the Library has received a complete file
  of the Executive orders issued by President Wilson during his term in office.</p>
<p>To Dickson Q. Brown, we are indebted for a magnificently extra illustrated
  copy of Dr. Doran's life of Mrs. Montagu, &quot;queen of the Blues&quot;. The
  extra illustration was the work of A.M. Broadley, who collected for this purpose
  portraits and autograph letters of hundreds of the men and women famous during
  the 18th century, including such names as Queen Charlotte, Lord Chatham, Alexander
  Pope, Samuel Johnson, Horace Walpole, and David Garrick. Sir Joshua Reynolds
  is represented by a signed sketch.</p>
<p>August 1, 1925-July 31, 1926:</p>
<p>By the death of David Paton, of the Class of '74, the Library has lost a loyal
  friend and generous benefactor. ... death on November 27, 1925 ... he gave to
  the Library his entire Egyptological and Assyriological Collection ...</p>
<p>Among the more notable acquisitions of the year is the collection of books
  by and about Rousseau, made by Hippolyte Buffenoir and consisting of 69 volumes
  and 242 pamphlets.</p>
<p>Of great interest is the gift of a group of 11 letters written by the Reverend
  John Woodhull of the class of 1766, and a member of the Board of Trustees from
  1780-1824, during his service with the Continental armies in August and September
  1776. These were given to us by George H. Cunningham, in memory of his wife,
  Evelyn De Vivon Woodhull Cunningham, a great granddaughter of the writer.</p>
<p>The bequest of Paul Weir '85 added to the Library 357 books of travel, of history,
  and of literature and enabled us to replace worn and soiled copies by those
  that are clean and fresh. The duplicates in the collection were, many of them,
  sent to the infirmary and others to the Public Library in Owensboro, Kentucky,
  the home of Mr. Weir.</p>
<p>August 1, 1926-July 31, 1927:</p>
<p>The most notable gift of the year was that of Mrs. Pierre L. LeBrun of Brooklyn,
  who was kind enough to endow the splendid collection on Montaigne and Rabelais,
  made by her husband, the well-known architect and scholar, which was presented
  to the Library two years ago. In March Mrs. LeBrun sent us her check for 15,000,
  1,000 for the purchase of specified editions, and the balance as an endowment
  for the acquisition of books on Montaigne, Rabelais and their times, This income,
  expended through the years, should make and keep this collection in the first
  rank.</p>
<p>As a memorial to the late Charles Richard Williams '75, the distinguished editor,
  scholar and poet, Mrs. Williams has given his valuable private library to the
  University. A Section of it is to be used as the nucleus of the collection in
  a &quot;browsing room&quot; in the new Library building. In this room, we shall
  hang a portrait of Mr. Williams, painted by Howard Russell Butler '76, which
  is now temporarily placed in the old exhibition room.</p>
<p>Junius Morgan '88, has enriched the Vergil Collection which bears his name,
  by adding to it the Bucolica printed by Quentel in Cologne in 1495, the Georgica
  of the same printer, 1499, the very rare Opera printed by Soncino in 1508, and
  the Richer translation of the Eclogues, Rouen, 1718.</p>
<p>To the kindness of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan we owe the completion of the set
  of Mansi, Concilia given to us by his father a number of years ago, a copy of
  the Roxeburgh Club edition of &quot;A Book of Old Testament Illustration&quot;
  and the Catalogue of the Murray Collection of drawings by the old masters.</p>
<p>Dickson Q. Brown '95 was so generous as to give us three valuable works on
  George Morland and a copy of Holman's graphic processes.</p>
<p>To Charles A. Pope we are indebted for a fine copy of Terence in the Venice
  edition of 1494 and to Charles Scribner '75 for the Julian edition of the works
  of Shelley.</p>
<p>Our collection of Princetoniana has received a number of notable additions,
  the most important of which is a manuscript record book kept by Nathaniel Fitz
  Randolph, who in 1753 gave to the newly established College the land on which
  Nassau Hall stands. This was presented by his collateral kinsman, Evan Randolph.
  Irving L. Roe '97 made it possible for us to secure photostatic copies of the
  letters written by Joseph Shippen Jr. during the Newark period of the history
  of the College. The originals are in the Library of the Pennsylvania Historical
  Society. Edward L. Howe gave us a copy of the rare print &quot;Washington at
  Princeton&quot; made by Nathaniel Currier in 1846.</p>
<p>August 1, 1927-July 31, 1928:</p>
<p>Among the gifts which came to us from friends of the University the copy of
  the First Folio Shakespeare stands preeminent. Formerly a part of the splendid
  library of William Augustus White and given to us by his family, the copy is
  of the greatest interest and value. It has been owned successively, during the
  last hundred years, by Sir William Tite in England, and in America by Mr. Robinson,
  Mr. Cooke, Mr. Brayton Ives, and Mr. White. It is peculiarly gratifying to receive
  this gift, since Mr. White and his sons are of the Harvard family, and they
  desire that this gift should express the cordial interrelation of the two institutions.</p>
<p>Our collection of incunabula has been greatly enriched through the gift of
  another anonymous donor of a beautiful copy of the four-volume Bible printed
  at Strassburg in 1480 by Adolf Rusch. The edition is very rare, only 13 copies
  being known to exist in America.</p>
<p>Mr. Junius Morgan continues to find new Vergils to add to his collection. Of
  the fourteen early editions given to us, seven are from the presses of Spain,
  two from those of Portugal, two from Italy, and one each from Belgium, Germany
  and England.</p>
<p>Dr. Frederick J. Tooker '94 has presented an exceedingly interesting collection
  of ancient Chinese money.</p>
<p>To the generous cooperation of the Princeton Bank and Trust Company, the First
  National Bank and of Professor Kemmerer, we owe a subscription for the service
  of the Standard Statistics Corporation.</p>
<p>August 1, 1928-July 31, 1929:</p>
<p>Of the greatest importance is the gift of Junius S. Morgan '88, of a unique
  copy of the first edition of Vergil to be printed in Paris. It was issued by
  the press of the Sorbonne, about 1472. For a long time it was supposed that
  only Bucolics and Georgics were published, but this copy, which was described
  at length by M. Ch. Mortet in Bibliographe moderne in 1906, has proved the contrary.
  Mr. Morgan has further enriched the collection which bears his name by the gift
  of a fragment of a Virgil manuscript, written in the late 12th or early 13th
  century.</p>
<p>Another important incunabulum came to us from the estate of William B. Isham
  '79, - a Vulgate Bible, printed at Strassburg in 1470 by Henri Eggestyn...</p>
<p>A similar group of Princetoniana was given by Mrs. Bayard Henry, and the collection
  was further enriched by the gift of Dr. Ralston Fithian Elwell and Mrs. C. Edwin
  Buxler of the Master's diploma awarded to Philip Fithian in 1775...</p>
<p>In this connection should also be noted the gift of Charles L. Burke '01 of
  a sword once owned by General Hugh Mercer.</p>
<p>Dickson Q. Brown has consented to the use of his name as the giver of the valuable
  Rowlandson collection...</p>
<p>To M. L. Parrish we owe our thanks for a copy of his privately printed list
  of his uniquely valuable collection of the works of Lewis Carroll.</p>
<p>Mr. Lucius Wilmerding has been gracious enough to give the Library a copy of
  the beautifully printed edition of the Boswell manuscripts in the collection
  of Col. R.H. Isham; and Col. Isham was so courteous as to transfer to us, for
  the purchase of books, his honorarium for a public lecture, in which he described
  the manuscripts and told of their acquisition.</p>
<p>August 1, 1929-July 31, 1930:</p>
<p>Our collection of books on manuscript illumination has been enriched by the
  gift of Robert Garrett '97 of a copy of his privately printed edition of Sir
  Thomas Arnold's Bihzad and his paintings in the Zafar-Namah manuscript, and
  by J. Pierpont Morgan of the Miniatures des plus anciens manuscripts grecs de
  la Biblioth&#138;que Nationale, by Henri Omont.</p>
<p>To Edward L. Pierce we owe the opportunity to purchase a copy of the Baskerville
  Book of Common Prayer, Cambridge 1760, and to Gabriel Wells the gift of the
  Seawood edition of the Works of Booth Tarkington.</p>
<p>August 1, 1930-June 30, 1931:</p>
<p>Mr. [Junius S.] Morgan has, during the past year, given us a copy of the facsimile
  of the magnificent Ambrosian manuscript of Virgil, which was once the property
  of Petrarch, and added eight important editions to the Virgil collection. He
  has given to us, as well, an example of the medal struck by the Italian Government
  in commemoration of the Virgil Bimillennial Celebration, and awarded it to him
  in recognition of his services in connection with it.</p>
<p>Mr. Cyrus McCormick '79 has presented to us copies of Stamler's Dyalogus. Augsburg,
  1508, and Huttich's Novus orbis regionum ac insularum veteribus incognitarum.
  Basle, 1555, which supplement effectively the Vespucci collection which he presented
  to us a number of years ago.</p>
<p>July 1, 1931-June 30, 1932:</p>
<p>The lamented death of Junius S. Morgan '88, on Aug. 18, 1932, has removed from
  the circle of our friends a man whose interest in the welfare of the Library
  was constant and vital, and whose benefactions were very great indeed. The Morgan
  Collection of Virgils will remain his monument aere perennius. His last visit
  to the library was on Jan. 5, when, standing in front of the cases containing
  his collection, he received, from the hands of the Italian Consul-General at
  New York, the decoration of the Order of the Crown of Italy. Only a few weeks
  before his death, he sent us a beautiful copy of the Virgil printed in Leipzig
  by Wolfgang Stoeckel in 1511.</p>
<p>Cyrus McCormick '79 has added another to the list of valuable books related
  to the discovery of America, given to us in the past years, by presenting a
  copy of Maurolico's &quot;Cosmographia&quot;, Venice, 1543.</p>
<p>July 1, 1932-June 30, 1933:</p>
<p>...the gift of Henry F. Montagnier '99 is a collection on Swiss history, particularly
  related to the Cantons of Geneva, Baud and Valais, Bern, and Neuchatel. Many
  of the books, particularly those related to the Reformation and the municipal
  history of Geneva are rare and difficult to secure.</p>
<p>1933-1934:</p>
<p>no specifics</p>
<p>July 1, 1934-June 30, 1935:</p>
<p>Although it comes within the record of the present rather than the past year,
  I cannot fail to call attention to the deposit with us by Mr. Andre deCoppet
  of the papers of Eug&#138;ne de Beauharnais, the stepson of Napoleon, and his
  Viceroy in Italy from 1805-1814. The papers comprise about 6,000 letters and
  documents addressed to Eug&#138;ne by officials of the Empire, and about 28,000
  letters, documents, and reports by officials in the Italian government, together
  with Eug&#138;ne's private papers during the period, after Waterloo, when he
  lived in retirement in Bavaria. So far is known, these papers have never been
  examined by competent historians and they are certain to contain much new material
  relating to the Napoleonic era in Italy. Dr. Richardson has most graciously
  consented to the release the room which he has occupied as an office so that
  we may have space for the installation of these manuscripts.</p>
<p>Articles in the Alumni Weekly and in Biblia have described the gift by Cyrus
  McCormick '79 of the manuscript of Strachey's &quot;Historie of Travell into
  Virginal Britania&quot;, and of those excessively rare books, &quot;For the
  Colony of Virginia Britannia: Lawes Divine, Morall and Martiall. London, 1612,
  and Rich's famous poem, &quot;Newes from Virginia. The Lost Flocke Triumphant.&quot;
  London, 1610. The three are monuments in the history of Virginia of the highest
  importance and are another evidence of Mr. McCormick's continued generosity.</p>
<p>July 1, 1935-June 30, 1936:</p>
<p>An exceedingly important addition to our collections in 17th century English
  literature was the purchase of the Henry Austin Whitney Milton Collection, which
  included first editions of substantially all of Milton's works, except the very
  rare Comus, Lycidas, and Of Education, a large amount of critical material,
  and many books and pamphlets related to Milton's political career.</p>
<p>The manuscripts and the personal and literary correspondence of the Rev. Henry
  van Dyke '73 have been presented to the Library by Tertius van Dyke '08, on
  behalf of the literary executors...His papers contain autograph letters from
  hundreds of men and women distinguished in the field of letters, and they will
  be a mine for the literary historian of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
  Particularly interesting are the letters dated during his service as Minister
  at The Hague from 1913-1917.</p>
<p>July 1, 1936-June 30, 1937:</p>
<p>During the year announcement was made that John H, Scheide '96, a generous
  friend of the Library, has deposited with us two collections of manuscripts
  of the very highest importance. The first is a portion of the oldest manuscript
  of the Bible extant. Some time ago there appeared on the market a number of
  leaves of papyri containing both the New and Old Testaments, and Mr. Scheide
  was the fortunate purchaser of 21 of them, containing parts of Ezekiel, chapters
  19-39. There is an agreement among scholars that this manuscript, which is remarkably
  well preserved, dates at approximately A.D. 200. Mr. Scheide has also deposited
  with us an extensive collection of vellum documents, deeds, wills, charters,
  marriage settlements, bulls, etc., originating in Central Italy and dated from
  the 10th to the 18th centuries.</p>
<p>We received from Mrs. W.P. Earle Jr. as a memorial to her son, William Pitman
  Earle III '38 who was killed in an accident in his sophomore year, a collection
  of 64 volumes which illustrate the modern treatment of the Arthurian legend.
  The collection contains the 2nd edition of Dryden's King Arthur, 1695, the suppressed
  Empedocles on Etna by Matthew Arnold [1852], and several other very fine items.</p>
<p>Gifts by Henry N. Paul '84 and Edward L. Pierce have greatly enriched our Shakespeare
  and Milton Collections. Mr. Paul gave us 12 early editions of Shakespeare and
  2 volumes of early criticism, and Mr. Pierce presented 1st editions of Paradise
  Lost and Paradise Regained. We are also greatly indebted to Mr. Pierce for a
  remarkable collection of postage stamps, containing about 30,000 varieties.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harry B. Fine presented two lovely volumes of John Donne's Sermons, which
  were printed in 1640 and 1649. They are a memorial to her father, the late Paul
  Elmer More.</p>
<p>John Forsythe Joline '07 and Mrs. Joline presented a collection of letters,
  journal and other documents relating to the Hon. John Forsythe, class of 1799.
  There were in addition 18 letters from Mrs. John Forsythe (Clara Meigs), 1803-1851.
  Mr. Joline also gave us some first editions of American authors.</p>
<p>An exceedingly interesting addition to our collection of Princetoniana was
  made through the generosity of Charles Scribner '13. This was a manuscript of
  The Tattler, an undergraduate publication of the '40's which preceded the Nassau
  Lit...W.L.L. Peltz gave us an interesting autograph letter of Charles Webster
  relating to the Great Rebellion in Princeton in 1816.</p>
<p>July 1, 1937-June 30, 1938:</p>
<p>Henry N. Paul '84 is giving us excellent help in rounding out our Shakespeare
  Collection. During the past year we received eight 18th century editions of
  collected works, together with two lovely editions of the Poems. Mr. Paul also
  presented a collection of books and pamphlets relating to Monmouth's Rebellion,
  Titus Oates, and the Popish Plot.</p>
<p>Our collection of the writings of Herman Melville is now complete, so far as
  American first editions go. This was brought about by the gift from Dr. Frank
  J. Mather Jr., Marquand Professor of Art and Archeology. Emeritus, of lovely
  copies of Timoleon, and John Marr and Other Sailors, two outstanding rarities
  in American literature. Dr. Mather also presented 54 miscellaneous volumes of
  special interest because of their illustrations.</p>
<p>Robert Frost delivered on the Stafford Little Foundation on October 26, a lecture
  entitled, &quot;The Poet's Next of Kin in a College&quot;. During that week
  a collection of Mr. Frost's writings was on exhibition in the Treasure Room.
  Mr. Frost very kindly presented us with three first editions of his poems, and
  Frederic E. Camp '29 generously made a contribution for the purchase of other
  Frost volumes.</p>
<p>The William Seymour Theater Collection was enriched by the addition of an unusual
  collection os material relating to the circus, from the estate of Joseph T.
  McCaddon. An autographed print of Sir Henry Irving came from the Estate of Joseph
  P. Bickerton '00. Archibald MacLeish presented the original manuscript of his
  play Panic.</p>
<p>Our collection of Princetoniana now contains what is the keystone of such a
  collection. There is an original subscription list which was circulated for
  the raising of funds for the &quot;purpose of Erecting a Collegiate School in
  the Province of New Jersey for the instructing of youth in the learned Languages,
  Liberal arts and sciences,&quot; dated March 5, 1745, a year and a half before
  the granting of the Princeton Charter. The acquisition of this most important
  item, together with two collections of papers of William Paterson (1763) was
  made possible by contributions by Henry J. Cochran '00, et al.</p>
<p>The original draft of the petition which was to have been sent to King George
  by the New Jersey Assembly protesting against taxation without representation
  is now in our collection of manuscripts. This is in the handwriting of Richard
  Stockton (1748). The purchase of it was made possible with money received from
  the following contributors: Mary F. Bradford, Katharine C. Clark, Arthur M.
  Conger '09, Juliana Conover, Daughters of the American Revolution - Princeton
  Chapter, Dean Mathey '12, Henrietta G. Ricketts, Richard Stockton III '09, Anice
  Terhune, and Owen Jones Toland '19.</p>
<p>Charles H. McIlwain '94 presented the Journal of the Votes and Proceedings
  of the General Assembly of the Colony of New York, April 9, 1691-December 23,
  1765, published by Hugh Gaine in the years 1764-1766...George R. Cook III '26
  gave us a lovely copy of Georgius Agricola-De Re Metallica, translated by Herbert
  and Lou Henry Hoover, and autographed by Mr. and Mrs. Hoover. Ten volumes containing
  the records of the cases of the S.S. Titanic and S.S. La Bourgogne were presented
  by A. Gordon Murray '91.</p>
<p>Coleman (37): &quot;From 1937 until 1941 John Hinsdale Scheide '96 deposited
  some eight thousand European documents and manuscripts which were given to the
  Library by his widow and their son, William H. Scheide '36. in 1946.</p>
<p>July 1, 1938-June 30, 1939:</p>
<p>The Library continues to be fortunate in the receipt of gifts from Alumni and
  friends. Harry C. Black '09 presented a remarkable group of manuscripts of Louis
  Alexandre Berthier, Napoleon's chief of staff. There are over a hundred maps,
  Berthier's diary for 1977-1983, and several other documents, all related to
  French military operations in the Colonies during the American Revolution. The
  acquisition of this collection is of very great importance and enriches materially
  the Library resources for historical research.</p>
<p>Louis Banigan '04 presented a group of volumes on Latin American history, John
  W. Garrett '95 presented a copy Colonial and Historic Homes of Maryland, by
  Don Swann.</p>
<p>John C. Cooper Jr. '09 graciously turned over to us a complete file of the
  Daily Radio Press Bulletin, published during the period July 21, 1918-April
  30, 1919, by the United States Naval Communication Service. This Bulletin, which
  was issued in mimeographic form in a few copies for very limited distribution
  to certain officials, gives the text of short wave propaganda messages picked
  up from foreign stations. Because of the period covered, this material is of
  very greatest interest, and it is unlikely that more than one of two files are
  being preserved in any other libraries.</p>
<p>Gabriel Wells, the well known rare book dealer, very thoughtfully sent to us
  the autograph manuscript by Albert Einstein of an address delivered at Swarthmore
  in June 1938.</p>
<p>A splendid gift came to us from Mrs. Dan Fellows Platt, consisting of a collection
  of books on mountain climbing. Among other volumes there is a file of the important
  periodical The Alpine Journal and a choice copy of the 8 volume edition of Horace
  Benedict de Saussure's Voyages dans les Alpes, published in 1803.</p>
<p>July 1, 1939-June 30, 1940:</p>
<p>Among the noteworthy gifts are the following: from William B. Bamford '00,
  Ars Quator Coronatorum, volumes 13049, a valuable and exceedingly interesting
  periodical of Masonic origin, devoted chiefly to architectural and historical

  the following gifts are worthy of note: from John F. Joline Jr. '07 some 1st
  editions of books by Booth Tarkington '93; from Robert M. Van Sant '07 two copies
  of the picture of the locomotive &quot;Princeton&quot;; a rare Currier print

  '14, Shelton Pitney '14, and John N. Stearns '14; a letter signed by President
  Tyler March 7, 1844, referring to an accident on the Princeton, presented by
  Stuart R. Stevenson '18 and J. Harlin O'Connell '15...</p>
<p>July 1, 1940-June 30, 1941:</p>
<p>An anonymous established a fund for the purchase of poetry and prose of the
  English Renaissance in honor of Professor Charles G. Osgood. A small group of
  contributors enabled the Library to publish a scholarly bibliography of Paul
  Elmer More by Malcolm O Young. Mr. John H. Scheide presented a 17th century
  Bible box and added 1,189 pieces to his important deposit of European manuscripts,
  including 386 autograph letters and documents of royalty, nobility, statesmen,
  and other celebrities of France during the reign of Louis XII to the beginning
  of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>Through the good offices if Professor Chinard the Library received a highly
  interesting deposit from Mrs. Marie Leroux Dehay of manuscripts, letters, newspapers,
  broadsides, etc., altogether 432 pieces, pertaining to Socialist experiments
  in the United States in the 19th century. Two desirable incunabula were received
  as gifts from Sergei Cheremeteff, who presented a copy of Strabo's Geographia,
  printed in Treviso in 1480, and from David A. Reed '00 who presented an excellent
  copy of Cicero's Epistolae Familiares printed by Jenson in 1471.</p>
<p>July 1941-June 1942:</p>
<p>Among the notable acquisitions during the year the following items were received
  through purchase: about 800 documents of James Chaytor, a sea captain and officer
  in the Civil War; 34 letters of the Bache family, including a letter from William
  Stahan, the famous London publisher, to Benjamin Franklin and one letter from
  Franklin's sister, Jane Mecom; 44 letters of John Ruskin; Rainolds, Overthrow
  of Stage Playes, 1599; Vergil, Bucolica, printed by Wynkyn de Worde, 1529; Sir
  Thomas More, Lubricationes, 1563; John Milton, Treatise on Civil Power, 1659;
  Rabelais, Oevres, 1558; Montaigne, Esais, 1594; Eusebius, Chronicon, 1512. The
  Library also acquired important microfilm sources during the year; a microfilm
  copy of The Pennsylvania Gazette, 1728-1790, covering about 14,000 pages of
  Franklin's famous newspaper; and microfilms of 91 American periodicals of the
  18th century. In addition, two further installments of microfilms of books printed
  in england before 1600 were received. About 8,700 photographs of actors and
  actresses were added to the William Seymour Theatre Collection, and also several
  thousand letters, portraits, scripts, account books, and other memorabilia of
  George C. Tyler, a New York producer.</p>
<p>The past year was distinguished by one of the most impressive gifts in the
  entire history of the library, the presentation by Robert Garrett '97 of the
  Garrett Collection Manuscripts, described by President Dodds as &quot;one of
  the world's great collections of books and manuscripts, embodying the best of
  literature, art, religion, science, and history of the Islamic and Western Civilizations&quot;.
  This munificent gift, embracing approximately ten thousand volumes of manuscripts
  ranging through more than twenty countries, had been appreciatively described
  by various scholars in June, 1942, in the issue of The Princeton University
  Library Chronicle and has been widely commented upon in the public press of
  this and other countries. Through the appraisal of the Arabic, Persian, Greek,
  Indic, and Western European manuscripts in this collection, as made by competent
  scholars in The Chronicle, it is possible to obtain only an outline of the rich
  scholarly resources that have been added to the University's collections: years
  of scholarly research, cataloguing, annotation, comparison, and publication
  will be required to realize the full potentialities of this great collection.
  It is gratifying to report that the donor has added meaning and distinction
  to his gift by expressing the wish that these records of ancient civilizations
  should be made freely available not merely to the scholars of the University
  but to the entire world od learning.</p>
<p>Among other noteworthy gifts to the Library during the past year have been
  the following: from A.S.W. Rosenbach, a series of twenty-seven letters from
  Jonathan Dayton of the class of 1776 to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison,
  covering the years 1805-1815; from the estate of Robert Bridges '79, through
  Mrs. Flora B. Witherspoon, 114 letters written by Woodrow Wilson to Robert Bridges
  from 1885-1919; from Stuart W. Jackson, two manuscript journals, with numerous
  maps, kept by Lieutenant Joachim du Perron, Comte de Revel, during his service
  under Admiral de Grasse. Through the generosity of various friends, the Library
  has been enabled to publish under its own imprint a handsome brochure describing
  the du Perron journals and including a full-size reproduction in color of the
  map of the fortifications at Yorktown, drawn in 1781 by Lieutenant du Perron.
  These journals and maps admirably supplement the Alexandre Berthier manuscripts
  previously acquired through the generosity of Harry C. Black '09. Generous contributions
  from Frederick E. Camp '28 and John H. Scheide '96 enabled the Library to acquire
  a handsome copy of the first edition of Richard Burton's Anatomy of a Melancholy,
  Oxford, 1621, thus completing the Library's holdings of all editions of this
  classic that were issued during the life of the author. Almost six hundred volumes
  of American History and literature, including such substantial works as Niles'
  Weekly Register and Documents Relative to the Colonial History of the State
  of New york, were given to the Library by various persons as a result of an
  interesting experiment carried on in the summer of 1941. This venture was financed
  through contributions made ny Wolfgang S. Schwabacher '18 and others, enabling
  the Library to employ a member of the Class of 1941 to travel through New Jersey
  and eastern Pennsylvania as a representative of the Library for the purpose
  of making its needs and policies better known and of securing gifts and books
  and manuscripts. The Committee having charge of the collection of letters and

<p>July 1942-June 1943:</p>
<p>Among the notable gifts to the library during the past year was that of Eugene
  O'Neill -10, who presented the manuscripts of eleven of his plays, including
  drawings, scenarios, and proof sheets. These plays belonged to the earlier period
  of his work (1919-1924) and included the following: &quot;The Straw&quot;, &quot;Gold&quot;,
  &quot;Anna Christie&quot;, &quot;Emperor Jones&quot;, &quot;Diff'rent&quot;,
  &quot;The Hairy Ape&quot;, &quot;Welded&quot;, &quot;All God's Chill'un Got
  Wings&quot;, &quot;The First Man&quot;, &quot;Desire under the Elms&quot;, and
  &quot;The Fountain&quot;. Mrs. O'Neill presented one of the fifty facsimiles
  of the handwritten dedication to &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot;, and Mr.
  Carl Van Vechten gave more than one hundred of his excellent photographs of
  the O'Neills. Winthrop M. Daniels '88 gave the typescript and proofs of his
  essay, &quot;The Passing of the Old Economist&quot;, together with more that
  a hundred letters from prominent men commenting upon the essay.</p>

<p>The list of donors during the bicentennial year is gratifyingly long, but it
  is impossible to record fully in this report. Individual acknowledgements are
  made for all donations and a detailed record of gifts appears in each issue
  of The Library Chronicle. The following donations of the past year are worthy
  of particular mention: from Marshall R. Anspach '19, volumes IV to VIII of Now

  Tennent and Samuel Davies of the Infant College of New-Jersey (Edinburgh, 1754),
  and a printed circular letter dated 1790 and signed by Samuel Stanhope Smith

  Professor Roy D. Welch, six scrapbooks of musical programs at Princeton from

  Galen, Greek physician and medical writer, most of them published in the late

  of 1901, five medals presented to Claude Silbert Hudson '01, in recognition
  of his outstanding accomplishments in the field of chemical research; and from
  Mr. Carl H Zeiss '07, a number of books concerning North American game, migratory
  birds, and other wild life to be added to the books given in memory of Henry
  Matthews Zeiss '40.</p>
<p>The foregoing indicates in summary form but by no means exhaust the list of
  donations made to the library through the generosity if alumni, Friends of the
  Library, and others. Many of these gifts are described and appraised more adequately
  in the pages of the Library Chronicle. Nor does the list include a number of
  highly interesting purchases made during the year. Among the latter are the
  following: 230 manuscript letters of Sir Paul Rycaut 1692-1699, giving detailed
  political and diplomatic information from Hamburg and the Hanse Towns to the
  Secretary-at-War in England; some 10,000 letters and documents covering the
  years 1900-1920 from the personal correspondence files of Arthur von Briesen,
  the leader of German-American organizations and activities preceding and during
  World War I; about 1250 manuscripts, letters, and documents, in part acquired
  by gift and in part by purchase, from the late Maria Lansdale, including letters
  of Hilaire Belloc, Richard Watson Gilder, and W.B. Blaikie. Additional purchases
  of important published works are listed in the appendix. Among the deposits
  made during the year was a collection of documents and manuscript writings or
  Parke Godwin of the class of 1834, deposited by Mrs. Harold Godwin. One of the
  gratifying donations made during the year was that of some 50 titles, all published
  by the Yale University Press in memory of the late Max Farrand '92. Though this
  important tribute to an admired and beloved scholar was anonymously made, a
  special bookplate bears the seals of both Princeton and Yale and carries the
  following inscription: &quot;A Gift in Memory of Max Farrand, Graduate of Princeton
  in the Class of 1892, Professor of American History in YAle University, 1908-1925&quot;.</p>
<p>Books, manuscripts, prints, drawings and all of the other forms of recorded
  knowledge that have come to us in such generous quantity from the supporters
  of the library do not complete the list. In addition to the bequests of various
  chairs, desks, rugs, and other furnishings by Morris Parrish for the proper
  fitting out of his incomparable library, other gifts of furniture have been
  received. Mrs. Walter L. Whittlesey contributed a mahogany table of some historic
  interest which will be most appropriate for the Staff Conference Room in the
  new library. Mrs Dan Fellows Platt contributed to the Museum of Historic Art
  two fine Renaissance tables. These, with Mrs. Platt's permission, have been
  designated for use in the Conference or Exhibition Rooms of the new library.
  Such gifts, which will do much to enhance the comfort and attractiveness of
  the new library, are particularly appropriate at this time when costs of construction
  and of furnishings are rising.</p>

<p><br>
  June 1947-July 1948:</p>
<p>To describe with any degree of adequacy Mrs. Marshall Ludington Brown's magnificent
  gift to the library of over 450 of the choicest books and manuscripts from the
  library of the late Cyrus H. McCormick '79 is beyond the scope of an annual
  report. The editors of the Chronicle are planning an issue to be devoted largely
  to this extraordinarily rich and varied collection. It is difficult indeed to
  single out for mention here merely a few among so many exceptionally fine items,
  for every one of them is an important addition to the Library's shelves.</p>
<p>The most notable, perhaps, is the second Plannck edition of Epistola...de Insulis
  Indie supra Gangem nuper inuetis of Christopher Columbus, printed in Rome in
  1493, which is being exhibited on the Freedom Train as showing the very beginnings
  of American history. The 75 items on Virginia are all of greatest interest,
  but some are fairly breath-taking. There is James Rosier's A True Relation of
  the most prosperous voyage made this present yeere 1605, by Captain George Weymouth,
  in the Discouery of the land of Virginia, London, 1605; there is the Beckford-Kalbfleisch-Hoe
  copy of John Smith's The Generall Historie of Virginian New England, and the
  Summer Islae, London, 1624, known as the &quot;dedication copy&quot;, in the
  original binding, with the arms of James I and the Duchess of Richmond; and
  there is the rare &quot;second impression&quot; of the narrative of John Brereton,
  A Briefe and true Relation of the Discourie of the North part of Virginia, London,
  1602. Here are incomparable riches for the Library's resources in American history--and
  they are only a few selected as being fairly representative of Virginia items.</p>
<p>As for English literature, the range is from Shakespeare to the Victorians,
  the McCormick collection containing the first two Shakespeare quartos acquired
  by the Library, A Midsommer nights dreame, the second edition falsely dated
  1600, and Poems, London, 1640, and Browning's excessively rare Pauline, London,
  1833; Milton's Paradise Lost, London, 1667, the 1st edition with the second
  title page, and Dickens's The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickelby, London,
  1839, a presentation copy to Mrs. George Cattermole with an autograph letter
  from Dickens to Mrs. Cattermole tipped in. To Princeton's list of the 100 Great
  English Books, so familiar by now to the Friends of the Princeton Library, three
  more 1st editions have been added: Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield, Salisbury,
  1766, Gray's An Elegy Wrote in a country church yard, London, 1751, and Spenser's
  The Faerie Queene, London, 1590-96.</p>
<p>Three more titles will serve to demonstrate the diversity of Mr. McCormick's
  interest and the collection's inestimable value to Princeton: a superlatively
  handsome copy of De claris mulieribus by Jacobus Philippus Bergomensis, printed
  in Ferrara in 1497; the Hoe copy of Homer's Opera, the edito princeps printed
  in Florence in 1488; and the Ives-Hoe copy of Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations,
  Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English nation, London, 1599-1600,
  with a copy of the Wright-Molyneux map in the first state.</p>
<p>A quite different gift has come from Edward Plaut '12, a fine collection of
  books from his own library---among them many autographed presentation copies,
  volumes with letters from authors laid in, and first editions. Both English
  and American authors are represented. There are presentation copies of Matthew
  Arnold's A French Eton, London, 1864; Dumas' Th&#130;&#131;tre Complet, in four
  volumes, Paris, 1868-70; Holmes' leaflet In Memory of Fitz-Greene Halleck with
  an autograph letter of Halleck laid in; Victor Hugo's Quatrevingt-Treiza, Paris,
  1874; and Joaquin Miller's Songs of the Sierras, Boston, 1880, a copy sent to
  Oscar Wilde whose autograph initials appear on the title page. A copy of The
  Ingoldsby Legends, London, 1840-47, has a pencil sketch and an autograph letter
  of George Cruikshank laid in; Elizabeth Bisland's The life and letters of Lafcadio
  Hearn, Boston, 1906, has a page of a Hearn manuscript; and W.S. Gilbert's Original
  Plays, London, 1895, bears on the half title, a quotation from Ruddigore in
  the hand of the author. There are several of Mark Twain's works autographed,
  and one with an autograph letter to his editor concerning A Tramp Abroad. Henry
  James' The Aspern Papers, London, 1888, is inscribed &quot;I must work in the
  garden--I must work in the garden&quot; - an inscription which seems to uncover
  a new aspect of James. The Woodrow Wilson Collection will be enhanced by three
  volumes bearing signed inscriptions, and one with a typed letter signed by Wilson
  tipped in. The original manuscripts of John Burrough's Matthew Arnold's Criticism
  and F. Hopkinson Smith's Kennedy Square (incomplete) are notable additions to
  the Library's American literature resources. These are highlights of Mr. Plaut's
  very handsome gift.</p>
<p>The valuable collection of United States stamps of the late Edgar Palmer '03
  was presented by Mrs. Palmer. It enriches the stamp collections already in the
  library and is of special interest at this time as the new building, where the
  Philatelic Collection will at least be adequately housed, is so nearly ready
  for occupancy. According to William H. Tower '94, the Palmer Collection closely
  approaches completion up to about 1936 in stamps for postal service, containing,
  in addition, many of the Fiscals, or revenue stamps. It abounds in rarities,
  among which may be mentioned most of those on blue paper, a block of twelve
  showing two of the five-cent error, the 1869 pictorial issue complete, the official
  department stamps (notably those of the Executive, Justice and State Departments),
  and three Pan-American Inverts, and the highly valued stamps of the second issue
  of the Internal Revenue Department. A decidedly interesting section of the collection
  consists of postmarked stamps on covers. Among them is the James M. Buchanan
  five-cent Postmaster's Provisional, in addition to a number of the more desirable
  of the early locals, some of them used in combination with the government's
  regular issue. The Edgar Palmer Collection will be a source of delight to the
  philatelist.</p>
<p>Through the generosity of Messrs. Thomas H. Eddy, Jr. '26 and Donald Simpson
  Eddy '37, and their father Thomas Eddy, of Evanston, nephews and brother respectively
  of the late George Simpson Eddy of New York, the Library received the splendid
  research collection on Benjamin Franklin. A lawyer by profession, Mr. George
  Simpson Eddy had spent some forty years investigating and studying the career
  of Benjamin Franklin. His collection, though it contained some rare and unique
  items, was primarily a scholar's rather than a collector's collection. Mr. Eddy
  was known to all Franklin experts as the last court of appeal on any disputed
  point in the versatile life of Benjamin Franklin. If his elaborate notes, photostats,
  and other data, aided by Mr. Eddy's wide and exact knowledge, could not answer
  the question raised, it was unlikely that any other scholar could expect to
  do so. Mr. Eddy was articulately impatient with slovenliness or easy generalizations:
  he was stimulated by any reasonable hypothesis, but he never voiced a categorical
  opinion until the documentary evidence had been overwhelmingly adduced. In consequence,
  his collection of notes, books, photostats of manuscripts, and miscellaneous
  will prove of immense value to students of Benjamin Franklin and his times.
  Among the interesting things in the 3,000 or so volumes and the various filing
  cabinets of carefully docketed notes is a bound volume of photostats of the
  manuscript of Franklin's autobiography in the Huntington Library, presented
  to Mr. Eddy by his good friend the late Max Farrand of the class of 1892.</p>
<p>Among other notable gifts are the following:</p>

  July 1948-June 1949:</p>
<p>During the year, Dr. Howard C. Rice Jr., formerly Director of the United States
  Library of Information in Paris, was appointed head of the Department of Rare
  Books and Special Collections. He brings to the Library not only an appreciation
  of rare books as objects to be cherished but also an understanding of their
  value in research. As a scholar familiar with the problems of research, he assumed
  charge of a newly organized department which embraces the rare books collections,
  manuscripts, maps, Princetoniana, and such other related special groups as the
  Gest Oriental Library, the William Seymour Theatre Collection, the Graphic Arts
  Collection, etc. In addition to Dr. Rice, the personnel of this Department is
  composed of Miss Julie Hudson and Mr. Alexander Wainwright, Curators of Rare
  Books; Mr. Alexander Clark, Curator of Manuscripts, (who assumed his duties
  at the close of the year and who occupies the position left vacant by the resignation
  of Mrs. Caroline Dixon); Dr. Henry L. Savage, Archivist; Mr. Elmer Adler, Research
  Associate in the Graphic Arts; Mrs. Marguerite L. McAneny, Curator of the William
  Seymour Theatre Collection; and a secretary and a clerical assistant to the
  curator of Manuscripts.</p>
<p>The rooms prepared for the Department were not available for occupancy until
  January. The first task of the Department was that of installing the various
  collections of rare volumes -- the Morris L. Parrish Collection of Victorian
  Novelists, The Rollins Collection of Western Americana, the Grenville Kane and
  Cyrus McCormick Collections, the Princetoniana Collection, and the books from
  the libraries of Jonathan Belcher, Jonathan Edwards and John Witherspoon, all
  of which occupy a suite of rooms extending along the south side of the main
  floor. The staff also installed in the bookcases along the south side of the
  Exhibition Gallery the Morgan Collection of editions of Virgil, the Patterson
  Collection of editions of Horace, the Le Brun Collection of Montaigne, the Scribner
  Collection of Charles Lamb, the Meirs Collection, and the Rowlandson Collection.
  Though the position of Curator of Manuscripts was vacant from December until
  June, the distinguished Garrett Collection of Arabic and Western European Manuscripts,
  and the John Hinsdale Scheide Collection of Medieval Documents were installed
  in the Manuscripts Room. These various collections represent only a part of
  the important collections of rare books and manuscripts under the custody of
  the Department. The principal stack area for both rare books and manuscripts
  is situated on Floor A and is accessible only by an inside stairway from the
  departmental offices and reading rooms on the main floor.</p>
<p>The greatly improved facilities for the use or display of rare books and manuscripts
  have resulted in an increased demand upon the facilities of this Department.
  Naturally, the chief users of rare books and manuscripts collections have been
  graduate students, faculty members, and visiting research scholars from outside
  Princeton. Many seniors, however, have also had occasion to use the collections
  in connection with their senior theses. It is inevitable that, with the very
  large number of visitors to the Library during the year, attention should have
  been centered upon an area which, both in its furnishings and in its priceless
  treasures, aroused the interest of everyone. This had the same effect elsewhere
  in this report -- an interruption of normal work and increased difficulties
  for a small staff bent on its primary task of serving readers. The interruptions
  were suffered gladly, but they nevertheless presented difficulties.</p>
<p>This Department, by its very nature, also acts as a center in attracting numerous
  requests by mail for historical, bibliographical, and other information -- requests
  originating in all parts of the United States and from several European countries.
  It is also to be expected that this Department should be the recipient of many
  requests from scholars and other institutions for photostats, microfilms, or
  photographs of materials in our collections. The proper preparation of materials
  for photographing and their arrangement and verification has entailed a considerable
  amount of the time of this department.</p>
<p>The William Seymour Theatre Collection has been installed in its new rooms
  on the second floor, under the direction of its part-time curator, Mrs. Marguerite
  L. McAneny, aided by student assistants. The new equipment has provided adequate
  space for the storage and arrangement of such material as posters, playbills,
  programs, photographs, etc., so that considerable progress has been made in
  the proper classification of this material, on which Mrs. McAneny has drawn
  for interesting temporary exhibits.</p>
<p>The Numismatics Collection has been installed in a room on the third floor
  where it is under supervision of an honorary curator, Dr. Louis C. West.</p>
<p>The Woodrow Wilson Collection has been moved into its special room on the second
  floor, with the aid of its curator, Miss Laura S. Turnbull. As Miss Turnbull
  is fully occupied during the day in another part of the building, it has not
  been possible to have the room open during regular hours. The </p>
<p> curators have, upon occasion, made the material available for consultation
  in the Rare Book reading room.</p>
<p>Thanks to the interest and voluntary efforts of the Rev. William H. Tower,
  '94, assisted by Mr. A.S. Arnold, a beginning has been made during the spring
  months in the organization of the Stamp Collection now housed in the Philately
  Room on the second floor. Rev. Tower and Mr. Arnold prepared an interesting
  exhibit, from their personal collections, upon the occasion of the formal dedication
  of the Library.</p>
<p>The Graphic Arts Room on the second floor will not be used for this division
  until 1951; meanwhile, the activities of the Graphic Arts division have continued
  to be centralized at 36 University Place, where the collection remains for the
  present.</p>
<p>The Map division has unfortunately remained completely suspended during the
  past year, as no trained personnel has been available for the tremendous labor
  of checking, arranging, and cataloguing the Library's map collections. However,
  thanks to the voluntary assistance of Mrs. Fantova of the Catalogue Division,
  a preliminary survey of the map collections and problems raised thereby has
  been inaugurated.</p>
<p>These &quot;related collections: raise a difficult practical question: they
  are located in separate and widely-separated rooms which cannot be thrown open
  to general use like the open stacks. Although the curators of rare books have
  willingly attempted to supervise these rooms within the limits of their other
  responsibilities, they are not able to provide adequate service. Without attendants
  in these areas at fixed times, such rooms risk becoming -- what they are not
  intended to be -- locked storage areas.</p>
<p>The Exhibition Gallery on the main floor was ready for use in February 1949,
  and exhibits have been on display there since that time. The preparation of
  these exhibits has entailed considerable experimentation with the new equipment.
  Much has been learned about their possibilities and limitations, which will
  be applied to future exhibits. The following exhibits have been arranged in
  the Exhibition Gallery:</p>
<p>February 15-March 15, 1949:</p>
<p>Selected books, manuscripts, and drawings from the A.E. Gallatin collection
  of Aubrey Beardsley's work. Upon this occasion, Mr. Gallatinwas the guest of
  the Library at a luncheon at the time of the opening of the exhibit.</p>
<p>March 21-April 8, 1949:</p>
<p>Printing designed by P.J. Conkwright, Jr., typographer, at the Princeton University
  Press, from 1939-1949. This exhibit, to honor Mr. Conkwright's ten years of
  work at the University Press, was arranged with the cooperation of Mrs. Helen
  Van Zandt and Mrs. Harriet Anderson, assistants to Mr. Conkwright. The exhibit
  formally opened in the Gallery in the presence of the staff of the Princeton
  University Press and other invited guests. Mr. Carl P. Rollins of the Yale University
  Press, Mr. J. P. Boyd, and Mr. Conkwright, himself, spoke briefly upon this
  occasion.</p>
<p>April 8-April 29, 1949:</p>
<p>Manuscripts from the Library's collection, exhibited in connection with the
  second annual meeting of the National Society of Autograph Collectors held in
  Princeton, April 11 and 12. Notable manuscripts, ranging from the Middle Ages
  through the Twentieth Century, selected to give an idea of the variety and wealth
  of the Library manuscript collections, were brought to the attention of the
  members of the NSAC. During the two days of the Society's meeting, certain display
  cases were devoted to member's exhibits.</p>
<p>April 29-August 15, 1949:</p>
<p>Panorama of America, 1492-1800. This exhibit, representing our most ambitious
  attempt, was prepared for the formal dedication of the Firestone Memorial Library
  on April 29 and 30. The exhibit presented an exhibit of books illustrating the
  development of America from 1492-1800, including many if the Library's rare
  and notable Americana. The resources of the Grenville Kane Collection were generously
  exploited for this exhibit. A brief four-page explanatory leaflet was printed
  for guests at the dedication ceremonies, and has been available to all visitors
  since that time.</p>
<p><br>
  July 1949-June 1950:</p>
<p>From Imbrie de Vegh, the Library received an exceptionally interesting group
  of over 60 books, mainly early books dealing with law, science, and economics.
  It would not be possible here to enumerate all the noteworthy items in this
  important gift, but brief mention may be made of the following: the 1st edition
  of the famous &quot;Book of Sports&quot;, published in London in 1618; the 1st
  edition of Niccolo Tartaglia's Nova Scientia, Venice, 1537, the earliest printed
  work on the theory and practice of gunnery; the 1st edition of the most celebrated
  medieval work on falconry, De arte venandi cum auibus, Augsburg, 1596, the major
  literary production of the Emperor Frederick II; and the 1st edition of Gabriel
  Naude's classic Advis pour dresser une Bibliotheque, Paris, 1627.</p>
<p>A notable addition to the Library's material relating to foreign finance was
  made in the gift of Mrs. Edwin W. Kemmerer and Donald L. Kemmerer '27 of the
  papers and reports of the late Professor Edwin W. Kemmerer. Professor Kemmerer,
  who died in 1945, was the first Walker Professor of International Finance at
  Princeton, and the organizer and first director of the International Finance
  Section of the University.</p>
<p>Among the larger groups of manuscripts added during the year is the gift of
  Mrs. Harriet Hyatt Mayer, consisting of approximately 800 items, being mainly
  letters received by Alpheus Hyatt (1838-1902), Alfred G. Mayer (1868-1922),
  and Alfred M. Mayer (1836-1897) during their respective careers in science.</p>
<p>As the gift of the family of Cleveland Dodge '79, Princeton acquired from his
  Library approximately 1,100 volumes, together with a group of 145 letters, most
  of which are from Woodrow Wilson to Mr. Dodge. The papers of Bernard Flexner
  came to the Library as the gift of Miss Caroline Flexner, Mrs. Hortense Flexner
  King, and Mrs. Jean Flexner Lewinson.</p>
<p>Notable among recent additions to personal and family papers in the Princeton
  Library are the papers of Lindley Miller Garrison (1864-1932), Vice-Chancellor
  of New Jersey, 1904-1913, and the Secretary of War, in the first Wilson administration.
  The gift of Merritt Lane, Jr. '41, the Garrison papers include personal correspondence
  from the 1890's to 1916, newspaper clippings for the period of Mr. Garrison's
  service as Secretary of War, and family documents. The Mexican border controversy,
  the opening of the Panama Canal, the Ohio River flood of 1913, and the Preparedness
  question of 1914-1916 are among the topics covered by the correspondence.</p>
<p>Mrs. George McLean Harper presented to the Library papers and books belonging
  to her late husband, a distinguished member of the Princeton faculty from 1889
  until his retirement in 1932. The papers include letters to Professor Harper
  from Gordon Wordsworth, grandson of the poet and from Professor Emile Legouis
  and others dealing with the preparation of successive editions of Professor
  Harpers's William Wordsworth, his life, works, and influence.</p>
<p>A donation from Robert H. Taylor '30, supplemented by an allocation from the
  Friends of the Book Fund, enabled the Library to purchase for the Parrish Collection
  a group of 95 letters written by Charles Kingsley to his wife. Being dated from
  1844-1874, the letters cover virtually the entire span of Kingsley's married
  life. Included in the group are six letters written on his trip to Germany in
  1851 and 24 written during his American lecture tour in 1874.</p>
<p>Important additions were made to the Library's John Davidson Collection. The
  manuscript of the Testament of John Davidson was purchased with the assistance
  of J. Harlin O'Connell '14, Bernhard K. Shaefer '20, William Thorp, and J. Benjamin
  Townsend '40, and approximately 75 letters were acquired on the Theodore W.
  Hunt and Francis H. Payne Funds, together with telegrams and other documents,
  mainly dating from the period following that day in March, 1909, when Davidson
  disappeared from his home in Penzance. The correspondence is for the most part
  that of Mrs. Davidson and her sons with Grant Richards, Davidson's publisher
  and literary executor, and reflect the progress of the long search for the missing
  man. The nearly complete manuscript of Fleet Street and Other Poems and one
  of the two autograph copies of Davidson's will are also included.</p>
<p>Allen Tate presented his correspondence for the years 1845-1949, as well as
  the manuscripts, galleys, etc., of several of his books. A series of 123 letters
  from John Butler Yeats to Mrs. Martha F. Bellinger was acquired with a donation
  from Oscar M. Kilby '19, supplemented by an allocation from the Friends Book
  Fund. The Library also acquired microfilm copies of 49 letters from John Butler
  Yeats to Van Wyck Brooks, through the courtesy of Mr. Brooks, and microfilm
  copies of 122 letters from John Butler Yeats to Mrs. Caughey, through the courtesy
  of the latter's daughter, Mrs. George H. Guest.</p>
<p>The generosity of Laurence R. Carton '07 enabled the Library to purchase a
  copy of the first edition of Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism, London
  1711. A collection of over 50 letters on the 19th century English actor William
  Charles Macready, the larger part of which are addressed to Sir William Pollock,
  one of Macready's executors, was published on the Friends Book Fund. Henry N.
  Paul '84 continued to increase our resources in English literature by presenting
  over 50 early editions of 17th and 18th century plays.</p>
<p>A copy of the 1st edition of Boothe Tarkington's first published novel, The
  Gentleman from Indiana, New York, 1899, containing many annotations and markings
  by Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson, as well as an inscription in Mr. Tarkington's
  hand, was given by Miss Elizabeth Trotter.</p>
<p>The Sinclair Hamilton Collection, exemplifying the work of American book illustrators
  and wood engravers from 1670-1870, continued to grow in scope and comprehensiveness,
  thanks to the generosity of Mr. Hamilton. John S. Williams '24, who has given
  many Audubon items to the Library, presented four drawings of birds by John
  Woodhouse Audubon. The Library received from Mrs. Laurence R. Carton and her
  son, William P. Carton '43, for the Jim Bridger Room, a watercolor sketch by
  Alfred J. Miller of the Scottish traveller Captain William Drummond Stewart
  at Wind River.</p>
<p>Five important items of Princetoniana interest came to the Library during the
  year: a handsome silver gilt pitcher presented to President McCosh on his 80th
  birthday by his former Princeton students then instructors in American colleges,
  the gift of David Magie '97 and James McCosh Magie '04; Jonathan Dickinson's
  copy of Annotations upon the Holy Bible, London, c1688, the gift of Mrs. W.
  Lester Glenney; the only known copy of the broadside containing the exchange
  of letters between the Board of Trustees of the College and Governor Belcher
  relative to the naming of Nassau Hall (1756), the gift of 44 Princeton alumni
  of Monmouth County, N.J.; the version book of Joseph Shippen, class of 1753,
  dated 1749, the gift of Edward Shippen Morris '28; and a volume from the library
  of President Witherspoon (vol. I of the third edition of Miscellanea Curiosa,
  London, 1726), acquired by exchange.</p>
<p><br>
  July 1950-June 1951:</p>
<p>The past year has been a notable one in the acquisition of rare books and manuscripts,
  both by gift and by purchase. Among the gifts which will mean much to the students
  of the history of American literature are the Boothe Tarkington Papers, presented
  by Mrs. Tarkington; the F, Scott Fitzgerald Papers, presented by Mrs. Samuel
  Lanahan; and the Carl Van Doren Papers. All of these extensive collections include
  literary manuscripts, correspondence, books, and related material such as drawings
  and photographs. Other additions to the &quot;Princeton Archives of American
  Letters&quot; are the original typescript of Conrad Richter's 1951 Pulitzer
  Prize novel The Town, and typescripts of works by Princeton graduates such as
  Hamilton Fish Armstrong '16, Norman Thomas '05, James Ramsey Ullman '29, and
  John Brooks '42.</p>
<p>Notable manuscripts in the field of American history are three missing pages
  from Thomas Jefferson's Farm Book, presented by R.W. Barrett '37; a letter from
  Jefferson to R.H. Lee, presented by B.K. Shaefer '20; autobiographical notes
  by James Madison; original letters written by Philip Carteret, the first colonial
  governor of New Jersey; the corrected typescript of Woodrow Wilson's &quot;The
  Tariff Makebelieve&quot;, presented by C.O. von Kienbusch '06. Manuscripts of
  interest for the history of New Jersey and of Princeton include a mathematical
  copy book written in intricate penmanship in 1721 by Stacy Beakes, presented
  by Daniel Maggin; and the 1849 diary of William Brisbane, presented by Mrs.
  Henry Pease. Manuscripts of scientific interest include the diary and photographs
  collected by Professor Charles F.W. McClure '88, who participated with other
  Princeton scientists in the Peary Relief Expedition of 1899, presented by Professor
  McClure. A fifth century folding manuscript almanac, known as a &quot;girdle
  book&quot; was presented to the Library by Mrs. Carl W. Jones of Minneapolis
  and Dr. Silvain Brunschwig of New York.</p>
<p>The recently published facsimile edition of the Book of Kells was published
  for the Library on the Theodore F. Sanxay Fund. Among the notable books acquired
  during the past year are &quot;The Schwerdt Catalogue&quot; of hunting books
  presented by Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Benson '99 in memory of their son Peter Benson
  '38; a group of 17th and 18th century books from the library of Henry Young
  '93 presented by Mrs. Richard V. Lindabury; a fine group of Arthur Symons first
  editions, presented by Mr. Albert Gallatin; A Natural History of Ducks presented
  by Carl Zeiss '01 in memory of his son Henry N. Zeiss '40; Paper Making by Hand
  in America, presented to the Graphic Arts Collection by the author and printer
  Dard Hunter; a modern French translation of maxims of Heraclitus executed in
  a limited edition by the silk screen process and presented to the Graphic Arts
  Division by the artist Andr&#130; Girard. The bequest of the late Robert K.
  Root brought his notable collection of books in the field of English literature
  to the Library. An original drawing by Lewis Carroll, letters by Anthony Trollope,
  manuscripts of W.H. Ainsworth and Sir James Barrie first editions have been
  added to the Morris L. Parrish Collection of Victorian Novelists, through the
  generosity of various donors including Mr. and Mrs. Donald F. Hyde. Mr. Sinclair
  Hamilton '06 has contributed additional books to the Collection of American
  Illustrated Books which bears his name. Memorabilia and several museum objects
  were added to the Philip Ashton Rollins Collection of Western Americana by the
  request of the late Mr. Rollins.</p>
<p>The extensive collection of postal covers assembled by the Reverend William
  H. Tower '94 was transferred to the Library after his death. John Currier '13
  presented an interesting series of die proofs of United States postal stamps.
  The Theatre Collection has received additions from many sources including 19th
  century prompt books, costume designs, movie stills, and material concerning
  the &quot;theater off-Broadway&quot;.</p>
<p>A more complete record of acquisitions for the period July 1, 1950 to July
  1, 1951 will be found in The Princeton University Chronicle; it may also be
  mentioned that these acquisitions were brought together in an exhibition entitled
  &quot;New and Notable&quot;, held in the Exhibition Gallery from May 15 to July
  1, 1951.</p>
<p>July 1951-June 1952:</p>
<p>Some of the notable acquisitions for the year may be listed as follows: a collection
  of some 8,000 European legal documents dating from the 11th to the mid-19th
  century, given by William H. Scheide '36; 15 volumes printed before 1501, given
  by David A. Reed, '00 (these additions bring the Library's total count of incunabula
  up to approximately 350); an atlas compiled by Abraham Ortelius, published in
  1580-84, presented by Edwin N. Benson '99 and Mrs. Benson, in memory of their
  son, Peter Benson '38; a significant group of illustrated books of the 16th,
  17th and 18th centuries, given by Sinclair Hamilton '06; a group of original
  or early editions in this same period of famous works in economics, politics
  and social history, presented by Imrie de Vegh; a collection of French historical
  autographs, including signatures of French rulers from Louis XII through Louis
  XVI, presented by William H. Sheide '36; a collection in German literature from
  Benno Elkan of Larchmont, N.Y., including original drawings by Goethe, first
  editions and autograph letters by Goethe, Schiller and Kant; letters, annotated
  books and manuscripts of Hester Thrale Piozzi, friend of Dr. Johnson, from the
  collection of Raymond B. Mixsell '03, presented by Mrs. Mixsell; a group of
  important Robert Louis Stevenson items, presented by Henry Gerstley '20. Other
  gifts in the 19th century came from Mr. and Mrs. Donald H. Hyde, J. Harlin O'Connell
  '14, J. Benjamin Townsend '40, and Mrs. H. Howard Hager. Purchases in this field
  include original drawings of Aubrey Beardsley -- to be added to the Library's
  Gallatin-Beardsley collection -- and an extensive group of papers of Arthur
  Symons. We also received Audubon's and Bachman's Viviparous Quadrupeds of North
  America, with 150 colored plates, from Edwin N. Benson '99 and Mrs. Benson in
  memory of their son Peter Benson '38, and Rex Brasher's Birds and Trees of North
  America, from the class of 1906.</p>
<p>Among numerous other items, the Library's &quot;Archives of American Letters&quot;
  was further enriched by some 400,000 letters and documents comprising the records
  of Henry Holt and Company; by letters and other materials on Booth Tarkington
  '93; by letters of Ridgley Torrence '97; by a group of unpublished juvenile
  plays by F. Scott Fitzgerald '17, by fifty-seven typescripts of Fitzgerald's
  short stories with autograph corrections; and by the personal papers of Otto
  H. Kahn, consisting of some 300,000 pieces in 99 standard metal filing drawers.
  Also added were the personal papers of the late Dean Christian Gauss.</p>
<p><br>
  July 1952-June 1953:</p>
<p>Although use is a significant measure of the performance of a library, the
  acquisition and preparation for use of books, manuscripts, and related objects
  is obviously of equal importance. Without acquisition, there can be no use.
  The figures appearing in Appendix A give quantitative, if not qualitative,<br>
  measure of the acquisitions of the Princeton University Library during the year
  1952-53. Comparative totals for the acquisition of printed volumes (either in
  the original form or in microphotographic reproductions) indicate the acquisition
  of more volumes than in any year of the Library's recent history except 1922-23,
  1924-25, and 1947-48.</p>
<p>In the statistical table in Appendix A no figure is given form manuscripts.
  There have been during the past year 291 recorded accessions of manuscripts.
  This figure represents only the number of &quot;transactions&quot;, 195 gifts
  and 96 purchases. However, it must be emphasized that such &quot;transactions&quot;
  range from a single autograph letter to such groups as the Wild Autograph collection
  numbering over two thousand individual items, and such large groups of papers
  as the James V. Forrestal Papers or the Edwin Grant Conklin Papers. There is
  no satisfactory way of estimating the number of items in these large groups
  - each of which fills a dozen or more file drawers.</p>
<p>As the figures indicate, the past year has seen a steady growth of the Library's
  collections to meet the needs of the academic community and the responsibility
  of the Library to preserve the records of the past and the present for future
  use. Beyond the statistics given in Appendix A there is space here for no more
  than a mention of some of the notable acquisitions of the year, especially those
  acquired through the generosity of the many friends of the Library.</p>
<p>Our collection of Near Eastern Seals was enlarged by 54 items donated by Robert
  Garrett '97, which have been described by Prof. Cyrus H. Gordon in the Chronicle,
  XIV, No. 1 (Autumn 1952), pp. 45-46. Outstanding among the early printed books
  is a group of five Florentine woodcut books printed during the 1400's. These
  incunabula, presented by a group of 21 Friends of the Library, have been described
  by Mr. Robert A. Koch in the Chronicle, XIV, No. 3 (Spring 1953), pp. 157-160.
  A copy of William Hubbard's A Narrative of the Troubles with the Indians, Boston,
  1677, containing the rare &quot;White Hills Map&quot; of New England, the first
  map produced in America, was presented by Mr. Sinclair Hamilton '06. The press
  release concerning this acquisition, reproduced in the New York Times (May 29,
  1953) and other newspapers, has brought to the Library numerous requests for
  photographs of the map. A more extended description has been printed in the
  Chronicle XIV, No. 4 (Summer 1953). Mr. Hamilton presented this map as the &quot;cornerstone&quot;
  of the Sinclair Hamilton Collection of American Illustrated Books from 1670-1879
  to which he has also regularly added many other items during the past year.
  A unique collection of nearly 400 specimens of European papers with different
  watermarks (1377-1840) was acquired for the Graphic Arts Collection, at the
  suggestion of Mr. Elmer Adler, with a fund turned over to the Library by the
  Friends of the Library. Closely related with this, and as evidence of the Library's
  world-wide interests, we may mention the Handmade Papers of Japan, edited by
  T.K. and H.R. Tindale, published by Charles Tuttle Co., Rutland, Vermont, and
  Tokyo, Japan, 1952; this four volume work which includes actual specimens of
  paper from 742 A.D. down to the present, was purchased for the Graphic Arts
  Collection with funds provided by Mr. Edwin N. Benson '99 and Mrs. Benson, in
  memory of their son Peter Benson '38. A modern photo-lithographic reprint of
  &quot;The True Records of the Manchu Dynasty&quot; in 1,220 volumes, has been
  presented to Dr. Hu Shih, formerly Chinese Ambassador to the United States and
  an honorary curator of the Gest Oriental Library.</p>
<p>Among the notable groups of books acquired during the past year are some 900
  volumes comprising the Hunting Library of the late Laurence R. Carton '07 presented
  by his widow; angling books given by Mr. Kenneth H. Rockey '16 and works on
  archery from the collection of the late Robert P. Elmer '99. First editions
  of Shelley, Kipling, Conrad, Oscar Wilde, and other English literature. A copy
  of Mrs. Piozzi's Retrospection (1801), with her manuscript corrections and annotations,
  was purchased on the Robert K. Root Fund. Charles Kingsley letters were purchased
  on this same fund for the Morris L. Parrish Collection of Victorian novelists;
  Charles Reade manuscripts were acquired for the same collection with the Annie
  Rhodes Gulick and Alexander Reading Gullick Memorial Fund. In the same general
  field of English Literature may be mentioned manuscripts by Robert Louis Stevenson
  presented by Mr. Henry Gerstley '19, several Cruikshank items presented by Mr.
  Gordon A. Block, Jr. '36, and letters of Whistler addressed to Jonathan Sturges
  '85, given in memory of Mrs. Mary Fuller Chalmers Wilson.</p>
<p>Robert H. Taylor '30 has presented the John Wild Autograph Collection, assembled
  by several generations of an English family and comprising of some 2,000 letters
  and documents signed by the great and the near great, the noted and the notorious
  from the 17th to the mid-18th centuries. Of particular interest for Princeton
  history is a group of letters written between 1740 and 1755 to Thomas Foxcroft
  of Boston by Jonathan Dickinson and Aaron Burr, Sr., respectively first and
  second presidents of Princeton; the &quot;Foxcroft letters&quot;, purchased
  by the Library, have been described by Pros. Wesley Frank Craven in the Chronicle,
  XIV, No. 4 (Summer, 1953). Letters of John Henry Hobart. Princeton 1793, and
  later Protestant Episcopal Bishop of New York, as well as drafts of his mother's
  letter to him while he was a student at Princeton, have been acquired through
  the generosity of Mr. Carl Otto v. Keinbusch '06. Princetonians of later generations
  are also represented in this past year's acquisitions. The Booth Tarkington
  ('93) collection has been enriched by a gift of Tarkington letters addressed
  to the actress Ruth Gordon, who acted in several of Tarkington's plays (&quot;Tweedles&quot;
  in 1923, for example), and by Tarkington's letters to his literary agents, Brandt
  and Brandt. These two acquisitions are the result of systematic efforts on the
  part of the Library staff, with the cooperation of Mrs. Tarkington (who has
  herself added many items to her previous gift of her husband's papers), to build
  up an existing collection. In this same connection should be mentioned typescripts
  of several short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald '17, turned over to us by the
  New York Public Library.</p>
<p>Another good example of &quot;building on existing strength&quot; is the purchase
  of two letters of John James Audubon relating to the collection of specimens
  for his Quadrupeds of North America, and the addition (as a gift of Mr. F. Sturgis
  Stout '25) of twenty-four of Audubon's manuscript descriptions of animals, later
  edited by John Bachman for inclusion in the published work. Our collection of
  materials relating to the 20th century American writers has been increased by
  an extensive group of books and letters of Edgar Lee Masters, presented by Mrs.
  Gertrude Claytor. The Archibald Gulick Fund made possible for the Theatre Collection
  of a series of bound handbills of the Boston Museum, covering thirty-nine seasons
  between 1848-1903; other material on the 19th century American theatre was presented
  by Mr. Edward Naumburg, Jr. '24.</p>
<p>Miss Isabel Conklin, daughter of the late Edwin Grant Conklin, professor of
  biology at Princeton for many years, has given the Library her father's extensive
  papers. These illuminate both Professor Conklin's personal and professional
  career, and provide important source materials for the study of scientific thought
  in the first half of the 20th century. Also of great significance for future
  historians, although in a different field of activity, are the personal papers
  of James V. Forrestal '15, presented to the University by Mrs. Forrestal. This
  important collection includes manuscripts of published works and speeches by
  Forrestal, correspondence, copies of reports and memoranda, particularly from
  his years as Secretary of the Navy (1944-1947) and as the first Secretary of
  Defense (1947-1949). Personal documents, such as appointments, commissions,
  and diplomas, awards, and medals are fully represented. For the time being,
  this collection is restricted, access being subject to the consent of Mrs. Forrestal
  and her two sons during their lifetime. In addition to the Forrestal papers
  presented by Mrs. Forrestal, the University has also received as a deposit from
  the United States government certain material which served as the basis for
  the published Forrestal Diaries (ed. Walter S. Millis, New York, Viking Press,
  1952). Through the generosity of Mrs. Clarence Dillon and Mr. Laurence S. Rockefeller
  '32, arrangements have been made whereby Princeton University will acquire title
  to these documents at the end of Twenty-five years; until the termination of
  this period (January 19, 1978), the U.S. Government retains control over the
  &quot;diaries&quot;, access to which may be granted only by the Department of
  Defense. Although neither of the two groups of Forrestal papers just described
  becomes immediately available to scholars on an unrestricted basis, it is nevertheless
  gratifying to know that Princeton holds them in custody for the future generations
  of historians.</p>
<p>In focusing our attention on &quot;collections&quot;, large groups of materials
  and easily distinguishable rarities, this summary has inevitably tended to distort
  the picture by neglecting the many single items which are steadily being added
  by gift and by purchase to our resources. For example, one might mention the
  purchase of several 18th century travel accounts of America (Kalm, Castiglioni,
  Brissot de Warville, et al) which have filled gaps in our holdings on 18th century
  American history, or the gift of a manuscript order book by Peter Kinnan during
  the Revolution of 1776, presented by Maurice Kinnan '13, and which adds to our
  resources in the same field. Comparable instances could be cited for many other
  areas of knowledge. It is the continuous acquisition of such single items, no
  one of which is perhaps of exceptional significance in itself, that builds up
  the bone and sinew of our total collection.</p>
<p>During the year a continuing study of the Library's acquisition policy was
  commenced and should begin to bear some fruit during the next few years in a
  better knowledge of what we are and should be acquiring.</p>
<p><br>
  June 1953-June 1954:</p>
<p>During the past year, a total of 34,018 volumes of printed books and bound
  serials, including microphotographic reproductions, was added to the Library
  by purchase and by gift. This is the largest number of volumes acquired in any
  single year of the Library's history, except 1947-48, when the accessioning
  of more than 7,000 volumes in the Parrish and Hamilton Collections brought the
  total to 34,312.</p>
<p>These comparisons are cited here for the record and not in a spirit of boastfulness.
  As a matter of fact, in an era of mounting concern over research library costs,
  there would probably be greater glory in reporting a decline in acquisitions
  rather than an increase. Each of these volumes, however, meets some need in
  the University's total program of instruction and research and represents the
  most careful attention to selection by the specialists of the faculty and the
  library staff. It should be pointed out also that last year's near record total
  placed Princeton 23rd in the number of books acquired by the country's university
  libraries, even though it was eleventh in size. In other words, our growth,
  though accelerating, still lags behind that of many smaller libraries.</p>
<p>To the number of bound, printed volumes acquired in 1953-54 should be added
  some 1700 pamphlets, 1200 theater programs, more than 600 maps, nearly 300 manuscript
  acquisitions (some large collections), and various other types of library materials
  as listed later in this section of the report and in Appendix A.</p>
<p>There is a space here for individual mention of only a few of the more notable
  acquisitions of the year. Most of these are described in detail in the Chronicle
  as indicated, and others will be so recorded later.</p>
<p>Mrs. David A. Reed presented some 150 books, as well as 10 medieval manuscripts,
  from the library of her late husband David<br>
  A. Reed '00; these include early printed books, first editions and fine illustrated
  books. Raymond T. Parrot '02 presented his collections of first editions of
  the works of the American writer Thomas Bailey Aldrich (see Chronicle, XV, no.1,
  Autumn 1953, p.50). Walter Van Braam Roberts '15 presented several editions
  of a book by his ancestor A.E. van Braam Houckgeest, Voyage de l'Ambassade de
  la Compagnie des Indes Orientales Hollandaises Vers l'Empereur de la Chine,
  dans les ann&#130;es 1794 et 1795, which has been the subject of an article
  by George R. Loehr of the Library staff in the Chronicle, XV, no. 4, Summer
  1954, pp. 179-193. Henry E. Gerstley '20 has presented additional materials,
  both books and manuscripts, on Robert Louis Stevenson (see Chronicle, XV, no.
  2, Winter 1954, p. 107). The Library's holdings of materials on literary figures
  of the 90's have been increased by additional books and manuscripts concerning
  John Davidson and Arthur Symons, presented by J. Harlin O'Connell '14 (Chronicle,
  XV, no. 4, Summer 1954, pp. 216-217), and concerning Aubrey Beardsley and Francis
  Viel&#130;-Griffin, the latter purchased on the Friends revolving fund. Through
  the generosity of Robert H. Taylor '30, and of Mr. and Mrs. Donald Hyde, it
  has been possible to add both books and manuscripts to the Morris L. Parrish
  Collection of Victorian Novelists. Sinclair Hamilton '06 has continued to add
  to the extensive collection of American Illustrated Books already given by him
  to the Library. Funds contributed by members of the Library staff enabled the
  Library to purchase as a memorial to the former Librarian, the late James Thayer
  Gerould, a first edition of Lope de Vega's Jerusal&#130;n Conquistada (Madrid,
  1609), described by Professor Raymond S. Willis in the Chronicle, XV, no. 3,
  Spring, 1954, pp. 159-161. As a result of the Library's exhibition of Emblem-Books,
  several such books have been added to the existing collections; these include
  a copy of St. Epiphanius' Ad Physiologum (Antwerp, 1588), presented by Philip
  Hofer of the Harvard College Library, and a copy of Philip Ayres' Emblems of
  Love (London, 1683), presented by Robert H. Taylor '30.</p>
<p>The manuscript collections have continued to receive important additions. There
  have been 291 recorded acquisitions during the year, about equally divided between
  gifts and purchases -- each acquisition representing anything from a single
  item to large groups of papers. Among the latter, special mention should be
  made of the papers of the poet Ridgely Torrence '97 and of his wife Olivia Dunbar
  Torrence, presented through the courtesy of Miss Jessie Ames Dunbar, sister
  of Mrs. Torrence, and Findley Torrence, brother of the poet; these have been
  briefly been described by Miss Dorothea Kingsland in the Chronicle XV, no. 4,
  summer 1954, pp. 213-214. Also of great interest for the study of 20th century
  American literature are the papers of Carl Van Doren, presented to the Library
  by his daughters. In the same general field belongs the correspondence of Samuel
  Putnam, acquired through the courtesy of Carl Otto von Kienbusch '06 (see Chronicle,
  XV, no. 2, winter 1954, pp. 108-109).</p>
<p>Contemporary affairs of the 20th century are represented by three extensive
  groups of papers: those of the late George McAneny, presented by his widow (see
  Chronicle, XV, no. 4, summer 1954, pp. 217-218); the papers of James Montgomery
  Beck (1861-1936), presented by his son James M. Beck '14 (see Chronicle, XV,
  no. 4, summer 1954, p. 218); and the archives of the American Civil Liberties
  Union. By arrangement with the ACLU the records of the organization since 1912,
  which have until now been deposited at the New York Public Library, with provision
  made for their continuation. It is expected that these records, comprising to
  date some 3000 scrapbooks (including correspondence, ephemeral printed matter
  and clippings, arranged chronologically and by topics), will be of increasing
  interest for the study of social, political, and economic currents of the 20th
  century in the United States.</p>
<p>Among the less extensive though not less interesting groups od manuscripts
  acquired are: correspondence and related documents of Elias Boudinot, presented
  by Mrs. Landon K. Thorne; letters of Jared Ingersoll, presented by R. Sturgis
  Ingersoll '14; letters of Chevalier Henry Wikoff, presented by Miss Louise Hartshorne
  (described by Allison Delarue '28 in Chronicle, XV, no. 4, summer 1954, pp.
  215-216); letters of the English poet James Elroy Flecker, purchased on the
  Neilson Abeel '24 Memorial Fund (see Chronicle, XV, no. 4, winter, 1954, p.
  108); the original manuscript of Somerset Maugham's novel Theatre, presented
  by the author through the intermediary of Frederick W. Frost '32 (see Chronicle
  XV, no. 2, winter 1954, p. 109); and an original Lafayette-Jefferson letter,
  presented in honor of Julian P. Boyd, by Stuart Jackson (see Chronicle XV, no.
  2, winter 1954, p. 105-107).</p>
<p>Outstanding among the acquisitions falling outside the category of books and
  manuscripts strictly speaking are: an original Audubon drawing of a Red-shouldered
  Hawk, dated 1809, presented by Edwin N. Benson Jr. '99 and Mrs Benson in memory
  of their son Peter Benson '38 (described in an article by Alice Ford in the
  Chronicle, XV, no. 4, summer 1954, pp. 169-178); the rare first<br>
  printing (1768) of the map of the Mason Dixon line, presented by Mr. and Mrs.
  John Doran in memory of their son Joseph I. Doran II '35; and an extensive collection
  of Rumanian postage stamps, presented by James R. Arnold '43 in memory of his
  father Abraham S. Arnold (described in the Chronicle, XV, no. 3, spring 1954,
  pp. 163-164).</p>
<p>Equally important are the thousands of other books, periodicals, newspapers
  and government documents representing every aspect of human knowledge touching
  the University's chosen spheres of interest and coming from every area of the
  world which flow into the Firestone Library and the nine other libraries on
  the campus.</p>
<p>Continued, if unspectacular, progress was made during the year on the study
  of the Library's acquisition policies.</p>
<p><br>
  July, 1954-June, 1955:</p>
<p>During the past year a total of 34,219 volumes of printed books and bound serials,
  including microphotographic reproductions, was added to the Library by purchase
  and by gift. As the following table indicates, this is approximately the level
  reached last year, just short of the all-time peak year of 1947-48.</p>
<p>Not included in this total of books received are many equally important library
  materials of other kinds, such as 2953 pamphlets, more than 500 engravings,
  portraits and photographs, 2580 maps, more than 2000 programs and other pieces
  for the Theatre Collection, and a large number of manuscripts. (Since a count
  of manuscript pieces is meaningless, the practice of reporting statistics for
  manuscript acquisitions was dropped several years ago.) The most noteworthy
  change in these non-book statistics is the number of maps acquired, more than
  four times the total for last year and indicating some of the activity during
  the year of our first regular Curator of Maps, even on a half-time basis.</p>
<p>The most important acquisition during the year, and one of the most important
  in the LIbrary's history, was the collection of American historical manuscripts
  bequeathed to Princeton by the late Andre deCoppet '15. The deCoppet American
  manuscripts, conservatively estimated to number some 3700 pieces, extend from
  1566, the date of letters of Catherine de Medicis and Charles IX relating to
  Florida, up to the year 1942, represented by a single letter of former President
  Harry S Truman. Although manuscripts from Colonial America are included in the
  collection, by far the largest number date from the period since the founding
  of the United States, especially from the years of the Revolutionary War, the
  Federal period, and the Civil War. The collection is an autograph collection
  in the sense that it consists largely of manuscripts from the hands of important
  national leaders, with most of these manuscripts being in the form of the personal
  letter. Most prominently represented are the Presidents of the United States,
  including all from Washington through Truman, with manuscripts of Washington
  (over 170 plus 7 autographed books), John Adams (over 40), Jefferson (125),
  Jackson (29), Lincoln (150), and Grant (over 100) forming the major groups.
  Military figures, not included among the Presidents, are represented by a sizable
  collection of the manuscripts of Nathanial Greene (over 160), William T. Sherman
  (50), Robert E. Lee (40), and by numerous smaller groups of other military and
  naval officers of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars especially. There are highly
  significant letters of many Americans of the stature of Benjamin Franklin, Samuel
  Adams, John C. Calhoun, and Henry Clay; and informative and characteristic ones
  of such diverse personages as Thomas Paine, Robert Fulton, and John Wilkes Booth.
  A selection of items from the collection was exhibited in the Library from May
  16 through July 6, 1955. A catalogue of the exhibition (a preprint from the
  Summer 1955 issue of The Chronicle) was issued.</p>
<p>Robert J. Barry '53 gave a copy of Pietro d'Abano's De Venenis, Padua, 1487.
  Included in the gift from Gordon A. Block Jr. '36 were a large collection of
  first editions of A. A. Milne; several first editions of James Hilton; a number
  of editions of Gray's Elegy; William Langland's The Vision of Pierce Plowman,
  London, 1561; and a letter from Aaron Burr to G.W. Lathrop, January 27, 1814.
  From Sinclair Hamilton '06 came over 100 additional items for the Hamilton Collection,
  the most noteworthy of these being a very rare Massachusetts broadside, Boston,
  March 8, 1679/80, with a woodcut of the colony's seal by John Foster. Mr. Hamilton
  also presented a copy of Schatzbehalter, Nuremberg, 1491, one of the most famous
  illustrated books of the 15th century. Kenneth H. Rockey '16 continued to add
  books to the Rockey Angling Collection. Among the hundreds of volumes received
  from the Shakespeare library of the late Henry N. Paul '84 were a considerable
  number of 16th and 17th century books. An important addition to the Princetoniana
  Collection was made by Daniel Maggin, who gave a copy of the two-page Recommendation
  of the Synod of New York and Philadelphia, In Favour of the College of New Jersey,
  apparently printed in Philadelphia in 1769.</p>
<p>Through the generosity of several alumni of the University, three missing titles
  on the Princeton list of the Hundred Great English Books were received in the
  library. As a result, Princeton has now passed the three-quarter on the list
  (now having 76), a far cry from the nineteen it had in 1936. William H. Scheide
  '36 presented a copy of the Royal, or so-called Authorized Version of the Bible,
  London 1611. A complete file of The Spectator, March 1 1711 to December 6, 1712,
  replacing an incomplete file, has been given in memory of Edgar S. McKaig '08
  by John G. Buchanan '09, Fred T. Fruit '08, and Aaron S. Swartz Jr. '08. Mr.
  Buchanan, whose generosity has already enabled Princeton to acquire a number
  of books on the list, also enabled the Library to purchase a complete file of
  The Tatler, April 12, 1709 to January 2, 1711.</p>
<p>From the library of the late Miss Henrietta G, Ricketts, Princeton received
  as her bequest a collection of 160 volumes, consisting of editions of Dante's
  works and books about the &quot;divine&quot; poet. Included in the collection
  are two 15th century editions of The Divine Comedy; Venice, 1477, and Florence,
  1481. Imrie de Vegh gave two 15th century Savonarola tracts, Copia della lettera...alla
  Christianissima maesta del Re di Francia, Florence 1495, and Epistola...ad certe
  persone, Florence, 1497(?), and a copy of the 2nd edition of Cornelius Jansen's
  Augustinius, Paris, 1641, the only copy of this important work apparently recorded
  as being in the United States in this edition.</p>
<p><br>
  William Elfers '41 gave a copy of the Offering, Cambridge, 1829, a very scarce
  little volume containing Ralph Waldo Emerson's first book appearance. Through
  the generosity of the Friends of the Library, Princeton acquired the unique
  dummy copy of the fifth volume of The Yellow Book with eleven cablegrams to
  and from John Lane concerning the suppression of Beardsley's drawings for this
  volume. Robert H. Taylor '30 presented to the Parrish collection the dedication
  copy of Dinah Maria Mulock Craik's The Head of the Family, London, 1852, which
  contains a presentation inscription in the hand of the author to Elizabeth Barrett
  Browning, to whom the book is dedicated; and Stevenson's childhood copy of Cruikshank's
  Hop-o'-My-Thumb.</p>
<p><br>
  July, 1955-June, 1956</p>
<p>Our collections have continued to grow steadily through gifts and purchase,
  although there have been no &quot;sensational&quot; acquisitions comparable
  to the deCoppet collection of historical manuscripts received during the previous
  year. Additions to the book collections include: a group of some two hundred
  16th century &quot;Martin Luther tracts&quot; presented by Bernhard K. Shaefer
  '20; approximately fifty emblem books presented by Mr. Silvan Brunschwig (as
  a result of the Library's expressed interest in the subject by its Emblem-book
  exhibition in 1954); a comprehensive run of the writings of the English novelist
  Rider Haggard, presented by C.O. von Kienbusch '06. Mr. William H. Sheide '36
  presented several significant works of music, including the first edition of
  Handel's Messiah. Sinclair Hamilton '06 continued to make additions to the collection
  of American illustrated books. A grant from the Humanities Council has made
  it possible the acquisition of numerous works, especially drama, of the English
  Restoration period. John G. Buchanan '09 enabled the Library to purchase the
  first edition of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe as an addition to its roster of the
  &quot;One Hundred Great English Books&quot;. In connection with the opening
  of the room for collections and sporting books, designed to house the Rockey
  angling books, the Carton hunting library and the sporting books presented by
  Eugene V. Connett 3rd '12, the Library received several rarities from the angling
  collection of Carl Otto von Kienbusch '06 -- a collection which Mr. von Kienbusch
  intends to present the library progressively.</p>
<p>In the field of Manuscripts, numerous purchases of single items or of small
  groups of papers have been made as additions to the existing holdings relating
  to such Princeton figures as Woodrow Wilson, and Aaron Burr, and to such literary
  figures as Arthur Symons, Stuart Merrill (of &quot;The Nineties&quot;), Wilkie
  Collins, Bulwer Lytton, Anthony Trollope and other &quot;Parrish Collection&quot;
  authors. Gifts of Princetoniana, such as diaries, notebooks, autograph albums
  and photograph albums of former Princeton students, have continued to strengthen
  this section of our manuscripts collections. It is gratifying to note that the
  Library is considered the appropriate depository for personal papers of noted
  Princeton professors and alumni. Among this past year's acquisitions may be
  mentioned a group of letters received by the late Warner Fite, Professor of
  Ethics; the papers of William Starr Myers, Professor of History, including an
  extensive sequence of diaries; additional material added to the scientific papers
  of the late George Macloskie. Professor Luther P. Eisenhart and Professor Willard
  Thorp, for example, have presented personal correspondence and other papers.
  Judge Harold R. Medina '09 has added to the collection of his personal and professional
  papers already in the Library's custody. Robert Garrett '97 has sent to us further
  selections from his correspondence relating to Princeton affairs. The University's
  Department of Public Relations has turned over to the Library scrapbooks of
  clippings maintained by that office during the 1930's and 1940's. According
  to arrangements previously made the American Civil Liberties Union has transmitted
  recent material to be added to its archives. Eugene V. Connett 3rd '12 had given
  the files relating to the activities of the Derrydale Press. Papers of the 19th
  century American writer, Parke Godwin, 1834 have been presented by Miss Elizabeth
  Love Godwin. In the field of contemporary American writing, John O'Hara has
  presented to the Library, in honor of Julian P. Boyd, the typescript of his
  recent novel Ten North Frederick; Philip Wylie '24 has given us the typescript
  of his Tomorrow!.</p>
<p><br>
  July 1956-June 1957</p>
<p>This brief survey of some of the notable acquisitions made by the Department
  of Rare Books and Special Collections during the year July 1856-57 may appropriately
  start with the 16th century English manuscript scroll presented by the Chairman
  of the Council of Friends of the Princeton Library, by Mr. Robert H. Taylor
  '30. The versified text of this segmented scroll (adapted from earlier writers
  on alchemy) describes the methods for finding the Philosopher's Stone, while
  the impressive drawings symbolize the various steps in the process. This same
  world of traditional lore and imagery is reflected in another of Mr. Taylor's
  gifts, a beautifully-executed 16th century French manuscript emblem-book, which
  makes an appropriate addition to the Library's growing collection of emblem-books
  of this same period. (The new manuscript is described by David B. Lawall, one
  of Erwin Panofsky's graduate students, in the Summer, 1957, Chronicle). A gift
  from Mr. Taylor and William H. Sheide '36 is a manuscript copy of a treatise
  composed ca. 1590 by the French political economist Jean Bodin, entitled Colloquium,
  Heptaplomeres de abditis rerum sublimium arcanis. Bodin's work - considered
  in its day a daring plea for mutual religious tolerance among the major denominations
  - was known until its publication in the 19th century only in manuscript copies
  such as the one now at Princeton, which was executed in Berlin in 1738 by J.C.F.
  Bodenburg. Also form the period of the Renaissance, and also of interest for
  the history of ideas is the rare first edition (c. 1556) of a curious work of
  fictitious royal decrees, ostensibly issued by King Henri II of France, but
  actually composed by a half mad lawyer Raoul Spifame. This work, in French despite
  its Latin title, Dicaerchiae Henrici regis Christianissimi Progymnasmata, is
  the first of four valuable books presented to the Library by Timothy N. Pheiffer
  '08. The others in this gift are a handsomely printed and illustrated Description
  de l'Afrique, published by Jean Temporal at Lyons in 1556; the first French
  edition (Paris, 1686) of Exquemelin's famous history of the buccaneers (the
  fountainhead of all later pirate stories); and an author's presentation copy
  of Claude Lebeau's Voyage curieux et nouveau parmi les Sauvages de l'Amerique
  Septentrionale (Amsterdam, 1738). The three last-mentioned works further enrich
  the Library's excellent collection of early travel literature as exemplified
  in the Grenville Kane and Cyrus McCormick collections. Another gift from Imrie
  de Vegh (described in Chronicle, winter, 1957), who has for a number of years
  been a generous donor to the Library, has brought us several attractive early
  printed books, including: Savanorola tracts', with woodcuts, printed at Florence
  in 1498 and 1500; the Illustrations de la Gaulle belgique (Paris, 1531-1532),
  also attractively illustrated; the first edition in English of Erasmus' De Contemptu
  Mundi (London, 1533); the first English work on Russia, Giles Fletcher's Of
  the Russe Common Wealth (London, 1591); and the first edition in English of
  Rochefoucauld's maxims, entitled Epictetus Junior, or Maximes of Modern Morality
  (London, 1670).</p>
<p>In the field of American history, the Library has made several notable acquisitions
  during the past year. The Aaron Burr material collected by the late C.P. Greenough
  Fuller (presented in his memory by his brother-in-laws, William A. Kirkland
  '19 and Dudley C. Sharp '27) includes some 200 manuscript letters and documents
  by and about Burr, as well as a comprehensive group of books and pamphlets.
  (See the Chronicle, summer, 1957 for a fuller description). The autograph collection
  presented by E. Stanley Atkinson '10, numbering some 250, brings into our &quot;pool&quot;
  additional letters by such 18th and 19th century figures as Jonathan Belcher,
  Elias Boudinot, Henry Knox, John Hancock, George Washington, William Livingston,
  Samuel Southard, and Andrew Jackson. (See Chronicle, Autumn, 1956). A group
  of 79 letters written during the Civil War by General Adam Badeau to General
  James H. Wilson of Grant's staff, was presented by Mrs. Sherley W. Morgan. An
  exceptionally important addition to the Woodrow Wilson collection came from
  the estate of Charles L. Swem, who served as stenographic secretary to Wilson,
  and who had before his death presented a series of shorthand notebooks. The
  new Swem gift includes drafts of letters by Wilson, transcripts of Wilson letters,
  speeches typed by Swem from his short hand notes, memoranda, and ephemeral communications.
  (See Chronicle, summer, 1957.)</p>
<p>In the field of modern English and American literature the past year has also
  seen notable additions. The autograph manuscript of Sir Walter Scott's Waverly
  novel, The Pirate (1822) was acquired with funds contributed by Arthur A. Houghton
  Jr., Mrs Roy Arthur Hunt (in memory of Mortimer C. Miller '79), Kenneth H. Rockey
  '16 and Robert H. Taylor '30. Manuscripts of Charles Reade and Wilkie Collins
  - both &quot;Parrish Collection authors&quot; - were purchased through the generosity
  of Mr. and Mrs. Donald H. Hyde, Bernard K. Shaeffer '20, Christian A. Zabriskie,
  and the Friends' acquisitions fund. Papers of the late Struthers Burt '04 -
  including literary manuscripts and correspondence - were given by Mrs. Burt
  and by the writer's son, Nathaniel Burt '36, as additions to material already
  given by Burt himself during his lifetime. The contemporary novelist James Gould
  Cozzens has presented literary manuscripts and correspondence, including the
  corrected typescript of his Pulitzer Prize novel Guard of Honor. Material relating
  to another important contemporary American literary figure, William Faulkner,
  has been enriched by a gift of Faulkner first editions from Clifton Waller Barrett,
  by Faulkner letters and manuscripts of French translations of Faulkner's novels
  from Professor Maurice Coindreau, and by numerous other gifts. (see Chronicle,
  spring, 1957)</p>
<p>Important additions have been made to several of our &quot;named' collections,
  such as the Philip Ashton Rollins Collection of Western Americana, the Sinclair
  Hamilton Collection of American Illustrated books, The Isabelle A. Rockey Memorial
  Collection of Angling, the Otto v. Kienbusch Angling Collection. It is in a
  sense misleading to speak separately of additions to these collections, for
  such collections of course form part of the general &quot;pool&quot; or &quot;magazine&quot;
  of rare books and manuscripts, which is in turn part of a still larger pool
  of the general library (and university) resources. Nevertheless, such &quot;collections&quot;
  - usually the result of some individual's enthusiasm, acumen and zeal - focus
  attention on certain groups of books, and thus serve as catalytic agents for
  the attraction of new acquisitions. Whatever the individual collector's original
  reasons for acquiring certain books may have been, these same books, as part
  of our general pool, will interest other scholars for other reasons. Books collected
  as &quot;illustrated books&quot;, for example, may also be &quot;illustrated
  books&quot; or important sources for local history...</p>
<p>During the past year, several rare &quot;Western&quot; items have been added
  to the Rollins collection, including William Gilpin's Notes on Colorado (London,
  1871); Information relative to the city of San Diego, California (1874), with
  contemporary photographs as illustrations; Correspondence relative to the Discovery
  of Gold in the Fraser's River District, in British North America (Her Majesty's
  Stationery Office, 1858). Mr Sinclair Hamilton - who is preparing for publication
  by the Library in 1957-8 a printed catalogue of the collection of American illustrated
  books which he has assembled and presented progressively over the past decade
  - has continued to make additions to this collection. During the past year Mr.
  Hamilton has added, among many other items, several notable 18th century American
  imprints. Through the continuing generosity of Mr. Kenneth H. Rockey, the Library
  has added to The Isabelle A. Rockey Memorial Collection of Angling numerous
  titles including a file of Baily's Sports and Pasttimes, from 1860-1922. The
  most remarkable addition to the Otto v. Kienbusch Angling Collection is the
  hitherto unknown work, The Arte of Angling (London, 1577), which served as the
  basis for the 5th in the series of occasional publications issued by the Library
  under the sponsorship of the Friends of the Library.</p>
<p><br>
  July 1957-June 1958</p>
<p>Some of the most important new acquisitions have been in the field of American
  historical and literary manuscripts. More than ever, we are entitled to claim
  that Princeton has one of the great manuscript depositories in the country.
  The papers of Samuel Lewis Southard (1787-18420, which include an estimated
  25,000 items, constitute the most extensive new group of manuscripts. These
  were acquired by the Library through the generosity of Albert Southard Wright
  '00, P.H.B. Frelinghuysen '04, Carl O. von Kienbusch '06, and Sterling Morton
  '06. Southard, a graduate of Princeton in the class of 1804, was later Secretary
  of the Navy during the administrations of Presidents Monroe and John Quincy
  Adams, and was an important political figure in New Jersey and in the nation.
  Southard's correspondence, consisting chiefly of letters received by him, will
  be of great value to students of the legal and political history of the first
  half of the 19th century. Many well-known names appear in the Southard Papers
  - James Monroe, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, John Marshall, John Quincy Adams,
  Daniel Webster, Edward Everett; many others, less prominent but nevertheless
  major political leaders in their own states, wrote to Southard giving him detailed
  information on the affairs of the day. Family correspondence as well as a wide
  variety printed ephemera represent other facets of the archive. The Southard
  Papers are now being organized and will in the course of the next year become
  available for research.</p>
<p>The Autograph Collection formed by Roger Williams Straus '13 has been deposited
  in the Library as a memorial to Mr. Straus by his widow Gladys Straus. This
  collection of American historical manuscripts numbering some 85 items or groups
  includes a contemporary copy of the Declaration of Independence transmitted
  to the state of Delaware, as well as significant letters from Washington, John
  Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, John Quincy Adams, and others.
  These manuscripts are all of a high quality compared to those in the Andre deCoppet
  Collection of American Historical Manuscripts, acquired by the Library 4 years
  ago.</p>
<p>Although not a manuscript, mention should be made here of an addition to the
  Boudinot family papers, presented by Mrs. Landon K. Thorne: a printed proclamation
  issued by Elias Boudinot as President of the Continental Congress announcing
  that Congress, as a result of disturbances created by rebellious soldiers in
  Philadelphia, would reassemble at Princeton on June 26, 1783. Green family papers
  presented by James L. Green and Beverley Green include important letters and
  other manuscripts relating to their ancestors, Jacob Green (1722-1790), Presbyterian
  minister of Hanover, Morris County, New Jersey, and his son Ashbel Green, a
  Princeton graduate in the class of 1783 and later the 8th president of the college.
  Through the generosity of Edward Duff Balkan '97, the Library has purchased
  one of John Trumbull's preparatory drawings for his painting &quot;The Death
  of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton&quot;. This pen and ink sketch
  now takes its place beside six other preliminary drawings for &quot;the Battle&quot;
  which have been in the Library's possession since 1904 when they were presented
  by Junius Spencer Morgan '88. The papers of Henry Norris Russell (1877-1957),
  Princeton '97, eminent astronomer, have enriched the Library's source materials
  on noted Princeton scholars. Professor Russell's well-arranged papers include
  his correspondence and manuscripts of scientific writings, reflecting his influence
  as a scientist and also as an interpreter of science to the layman.</p>
<p>In the field of American literature, we may record significant additions to
  important groups already in the Library's possession: a series of 28 letters
  and telegrams from Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald to their friends Mr. and Mrs Charles
  O. Kalman, presented by Mrs. Kalman; a series of more than 50 letters written
  by Booth Tarkington to John Peter Toohey, press agent in the office of the theatrical
  producer George Tyler, presented by Carl Otto von Kienbusch '06 literary manuscripts
  and correspondence of Struthers Burt (1882-1954) added by Burt's widow and his
  son Nathaniel Burt '36, to the material previously presented by them (the spring-summer
  issue of The Chronicle will include an article on Struthers Burt by his son
  and a check list of his writings compiled by Alexander D. Wainwright); Countess
  Eleanora Marion-Crawford Rocca has given to the Library the manuscript of four
  novels written by her father Francis Marion Crawford (1854-1909). An extensive
  collection of great potential interest for American history and letters in the
  20th century is the papers of Louis Adamic (1899-1951), the American writer
  of Slovenian origin, which have been presented through the efforts of Mrs. Adamic
  by the Louis Adamic Foundation. The Adamic Papers, as yet unorganized, include
  literary manuscripts, correspondence, and extensive research notes on the subject
  of minority groups in the United States.</p>
<p>Not all of the recently added manuscripts are in the field of American history
  and literature; English literature is also well represented. For example, letters
  of Penelope Pennington (1752?-1827), a friend and contemporary of Mrs. Piozzi,
  were presented by Mrs. Knight Wooley and other manuscripts of Mrs. Pennington
  by Robert F. Metzdorf. A group of original drawings and books illustrated by
  George Cruikshank were added to the Library's extensive Cruikshank collection
  by A.J. Rosenfeld. To the Morris L. Parrish Collection of Victorian Novelists
  were added, through the generosity of Christian A. Zabriskie, manuscripts of
  Charles Reade. To the Library's unrivalled Beardsley Collection, more letters,
  drawings, and books by Aubrey Beardsley were presented by Charles Feinberg in
  honor of Edmund Wilson '16. Thanks to the Friends of the Princeton Library and
  to Eton Cromwell '16, the Library was enabled to purchase in memory of J. Harlin
  O'Connell '14 an extensive correspondence file of the English novelist Mary
  Chavelita Bright (1860-1945) who wrote under the name of George Egerton and
  whose correspondence includes such names as Sir James M. Barrie, W. Somerset
  Maugham, George Bernard Shaw, and William Butler Yeats. The collection of books
  and manuscripts of English authors of the 1890's formed by the late J. Harlin
  O'Connell '14, presented by his daughter, Mrs. Pierre Matisse, is one of the
  notable acquisitions of the year, and indeed one of the Library's outstanding
  literary collections. First editions, association copies, as well as literary
  manuscripts, letters and drawings are included, representing such authors such
  as Aubrey Beardsley, Max Beerbohm, Ernest Dowson, John Gray, George Moore, Stephen
  Phillips, A.E. Housman, George Bernard Shaw, and Oscar Wilde.</p>
<p>Turning from manuscripts to printed books, mention should be made of the extensive
  acquisition of works in the field of Germanic literature acquired through the
  generosity of Carl Otto von Kienbusch '06 and to be known as the Kretzschmar
  von Kienbusch Germanic Collection. This includes works extending from the 17th
  through the 20th centuries.; although it brings additional rare works and first
  editions to the Library's holdings, its special strength is in the works of
  historical and critical scholarship in various areas of Germanic studies. An
  important group of 16th and 17th century European works on the Near East, chiefly
  Turkey, formerly in the collection of G.J. Arvanitides, has been acquired on
  the Oriental Studies Fund. These well exemplify the theme of East and West relations,
  as do for the Far East a significant group of late 17th century pamphlets relating
  to the so called Rites Controversy. Also related to this key episode in the
  history of the European missionary effort in China is the rare Sino-European
  book presented by John M. Crawford, Jr. This book of 61 double leaves, with
  texts in Latin, Chinese and Manchu, was printed from woodblocks in the Chinese
  manner in Peking in 1701 under the auspices of jesuit missionaries from Europe;
  in their Brevis Relatio or Brief Narrative, the Jesuit missionaries whose signatures
  appear on facsimile on the final page of the book relate their presence at the
  Imperial court where they received, through the intermediary of high Manchu
  officials, the K'ang-hsi Emperor's reply to the memorial requesting his interpretation
  of the Confucian rites, A second and rare Sino-European imprint has been added
  to the Gest Oriental Library, thanks to a contribution from the Li Foundation;
  this is a single sheet printed from woodblocks in red ink, with text in Latin,
  Chinese, and Manchu, of an Imperial Rescript of 1716 intended to facilitate
  travel of missionary messengers within China.</p>
<p>During the past year, the inter-departmental project known as &quot;Princeton
  Studies in the Latter 17th Century&quot;, has borne important fruit as far as
  the Library's rare book collections are concerned. As a result of a program
  os systematic acquisition, outlined by Professor James Holly Hanford, visiting
  bibliographer, and thanks to the response to the appeal for funds made by the
  Librarian in a special issue of the &quot;Needs&quot; bulletin circulated among
  the Friends of the Library, important acquisitions have been made. These are
  chiefly English works, including such authors as Thomas Traherne, Richard Baxter,
  Thomas Browne, Robert Hooke, and Walter Charleton, and representing various
  subject areas -- theology and philosophy, science, history, and journalism,
  poetry and drama.</p>
<p>An anonymous gift of a group of some 140 volumes, including splendid examples
  of binding, illustration, and printing, has also enriched the 17th century material
  with several important works such as: The Entertainment of His Most Excellent
  Majestie Charles II, in his passage through the city of London to his coronation
  (London, 1662); Edward Waterhouse's A short Narrative of the Late Dreadful Fire
  in London (London, 1667); The History of the Coronation of...James II (London,
  1687). The anonymous gift just mentioned is particularly strong in illustrated
  French works relating to coronations, entre&#130;s, festivals, and other great
  occasions. Mention may be made, for example, of the volume commemorating the
  reception tendered by the city of Paris to King Louis XIV and his Bride, Marie-Th&#130;r&#138;se
  of Austria, in August 1660; Les Plaisers de l'Isle Enchant&#130;e, plates depicting
  a ballet by Moli&#138;re and other festivities at Versailles in May 1664; and
  the elaborately illustrated volume issued by the city of Strasbourg to commemorate
  the visit of King Louis XV in October 1774. Another superb illustrated book
  received by the anonymous donor is the Monument du Costume Physique et Morale
  de la fin du 18e Si&#130;cle, an album of 76 engravings after Moreau Le Jeune,
  with text by Restif de la Bretonne. Still other works, important for 18th century
  taste, notably in the field of architecture and landscape gardening, include
  collections of views of Paris and Versailles by Perelle, Israel Silvestre, and
  others, as well as Humphrey Repton's treatise entitled Sketches and Hints on
  Landscape Gardening (London, 1794).</p>
<p>Closely related to the illustrated books mentioned are a series of 17th and
  18th century engravings presented to The Graphic Arts Collection by Davenport
  West '05. Books presented by Sinclair Hamilton '06 - in addition to those regularly
  added to the collection of American illustrated books bearing his name - include
  early printed books of both artistic and textual significance: for example,
  Robert Gaguin, Compendium de origine et egstis Francorum (Paris, 1500); an edition
  of Terence's dramatic works, with woodcuts, printed at Paris in 1552; Andrea
  Alciati, Emblematum Liber (Augsburg, 1531), the first edition of the famous
  emblem-book which set the pattern for countless successors during the next two
  centuries. Two recently acquired books of importance for the history of music
  are: Sebald Heyden, Musicae (Nuremberg, 1537); and Ludovico Zacconi, Prattica
  di Musica (Venice, 1596-1622), presented by Harry C. Robb '97, Paul Bedford
  '97, Ernest Savage '19, and Nathaniel Burt '36. Mrs. Sinclair Hamilton has presented
  examples of fine modern hand binding executed by herself. Further examples of
  the work of the Derrydale Press have come from Eugene V. Connett III '12. The
  last major work designed by the modern American typographer Bruce Rogers printed
  in a limited edition in New York by the press of Abraham Colish in 1955 has
  been presented by Mr. Colish.</p>
<p>The above enumeration is far from complete, but it can serve as a sampling
  of recent acquisitions and as an indication of the fact that these additions
  are limited to no particular century, country, or subject - thus mirroring the
  universal scope of the Princeton University Library.</p>
<p><br>
  July 1958-June 1959</p>
<p>The establishment in the Princeton University Library of the John Foster Dulles
  '08 Library of Diplomatic History, centering around Mr. Dulles' papers, was
  announced in May, 1959. The Department of State and the University simultaneously
  made known an agreement concerning the establishment in the Library of a collection
  of microfilmed copies of official documents of the Department of State relating
  to Mr. Dulles' tenure as Secretary. His own personal papers were presented to
  the University by Mr. Dulles shortly before his death. The microfilms of the
  official documents will be physically located in the Dulles Library under approved
  safeguard conditions as prescribed by applicable laws and Executive Orders and
  will be subject to the same restrictions, limitations, and controls as are the
  original documents in the Department of State. Title and control of these copies
  will remain with the Federal Government until such time as all classification
  and restrictions have been removed from the originals. In giving his personal
  papers to Princeton as a research collection, Secretary Dulles declared that
  access to the papers, for the purpose of furthering bona fide research in the
  fields of history, political science, international relations, and related subjects,
  should be granted as widely as possible. Scholars seeking to consult these personal
  papers, once they have been completely organized and catalogued, must receive
  through the Library the written approval of a committee appointed by Mr. Dulles.</p>
<p>An important collection of papers of Edward Coles (1786-1868), second governor
  of Illinois and a noted early opponent of slavery, has been presented to the
  Library by George A. Robbins '20, Edward C. Robbins '22, James M. Robbins '26
  and Oliver W. Robbins. This new acquisition of some 400 pieces adds significantly
  to the Library's extensive manuscripts of American figures of the first half
  of the 19th century, containing as it does significant letters of James and
  Dolley Madison, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, Robert Fulton, Nicholas Biddle,
  Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster, and others.</p>
<p>An autograph collection numbering some 500 items has been presented by DeForest
  M. Alexander '24. Letters written to members of the Alexander family formed
  the basis of the collection, especially those received by the artist John White
  Alexander (1856-1915) and James W. Alexander, of the class of 1860. Numerous
  others of the autographs were collected from various sources by Henry Martyn
  Alexander '90, father of the donor. These are letters of Daniel Webster and
  Presidents Grant, Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, and Theodore Roosevelt. There are
  six letters of Samuel L. Clemens. Walt Whitman, William Dean Howells, Henry
  James, Thornton Wilder, and Gertrude Stein are represented. James McNeill Whistler
  is represented by six letters to John W. Alexander; other autographs of artists
  include those of Eastman Johnson, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, John La Farge, and
  Rodin. There are several letters of officers in both the Union and Confederate
  armies in the Civil War, of which six are addressed to General Robert E. Lee.
  There are autographs of persons prominently identified with Princeton, such
  as Joseph Henry, Arnold Guyot, Samuel Miller, Charles Hodge, Henry Van Dyke,
  and Presidents James Carnahan, James McCosh, Francis Landey Patton, and Woodrow
  Wilson. A group of nearly fifty Italian autographs in the collection includes
  those of notables from the 16th to the 19th century. There are also several
  English autographs, among which are letters of Robert Louis Stevenson, Thomas
  Hardy, and Alfred Noyes.</p>
<p>Papers of the late Ivy L. Lee '98, as well as some twelve hundred books from
  his library, have been presented by his sons, James W. Lee II '28, and Ivy L.
  Lee Jr. '31. A large body of papers of the author Philip Wylie '24 has been
  given by Mr. Wylie. James Gould Cozzens has added to the Cozzens Papers the
  corrected typescript and the corrected galley proofs of By Love Possessed, as
  well as more than 150 letters written to him by writers, publishers, critics,
  fans, and others, with carbons of his replies. Included in the correspondence,
  which covers the years 1933-1954, are letters from Louis Bromfield, Erskine
  Caldwell, Joyce Cary, Sidney Howard, and Oliver La Farge.</p>
<p>From Mrs. David H. McAlpin the Library has received the records of the Ladies
  Auxiliary to the Isabella McCosh Infirmary, Additions have been made to the
  Booth Tarkington '93 Collection. Barton Currie has given his correspondence
  with Mr. and Mrs. Tarkington. The file covers the years 1921-1945 and consists
  of sixty letters and ten telegrams from Tarkington, four letters from Mrs. Tarkington,
  and the carbons of thirty-five letters and sixteen telegrams from Mr. Currie
  to Mr. Tarkington. Mr. Currie has also given, with Mrs. Currie, a collection
  of more than 60 books by and about Tarkington, many of which contain autograph
  inscriptions by the author. From Miss Helen Hayes have come four long letters
  written to her in 1940 by Tarkington concerning the radio play Lady Hamilton
  and her Nelson. During the past year, the Library has also acquired by purchase
  a small number of Tarkington letters. Nine cartons of additions to the archives
  of the American Civil Liberties Union, for the years 1953-54, have been received
  from the Union.</p>

  Dumbauld '26, The Bill of Rights and What it Means Today (1957); Richard Powell

<p>Robert H. Taylor '30, Chairman of the Friends of the Princeton University Library,

  for the considerable number of association items included in it. Among the authors
  represented are Anne and Charlotte Bront&#137;, Samuel Butler, George Eliot,
  Thomas Hardy, Frederick Marryat, Emily Eden, Elizabeth Gaskell, H. Rider Haggard,
  Charles Reade, Sir Walter Scott, Joseph H. Shorthouse, and W. M. Thackeray.

<p>During the past year the Library has received for its Numismatics Collection
  four substantial gifts of coin and paper currency. Charles A. Cass '02 bequeathed
  an outstanding collection of United States paper money with particular emphasis
  on bills issued since the formation of the Federal Reserve Banks. With this
  paper money collection came some hundreds of coins, mostly United States and
  mostly in the denominations up to and including the quarter dollar. From Friends
  of the Library have been received fourteen European and South American gold
  coins; forty-seven of Roman and modern gold; and 437 modern gold coins struck
  by some sixty issuing bodies. Clifton Waller Barrett has given more than seventy

  Oriental Library was a copy of the 591-volume Shanghai edition (1936) of the
  Chi-sha Tripitaka.</p>
<p>The past year has been a beneficial one for the Morris L. Parrish Collection
  of Victorian Novelists, 135 volumes, more than 350 manuscript items, and other
  material having been acquired for it. As has been the case in previous years,
  this continued growth of the collection has been largely due to the generosity
  of Mr. and Mrs. Donald F. Hyde, Robert H. Taylor '30, Henry E. Gerstly '20,
  Kenneth H. Rockey '16, Mrs. Roy Arthur HUnt, and the Friends of the Princeton
  Library. Among the notable acquisitions were: the autograph manuscript of Bulwer-Lytton's
  novel Eugene Aram (published in 1832); forty letters written by Bulwer-Lytton;
  a considerable portion of the autograph manuscript of Charles Reade's novel
  Griffith Gaunt, (1866); three Reade notebooks and two of his scare privately
  printed plays, with manuscript changes in his hand (Put Yourself in His Place,
  1870, Singleheart and Doubleface, 1882); the notebook kept by Anthony Trollope
  on his trip to South Africa in 1877; six manuscript travel books maintained
  by Trollope from 1841 to 1871; and forty letters written by Charles Kingsley.</p>
<p>The acquisition program in English civilization of the latter seventeenth century,
  for which increased funds became available in the spring of 1958, has begun
  to yield results of potential importance for research at Princeton. The chronological
  limits of this period, comprising as it does the restoration of the house of
  Stuart in 1660 and the Whig revolution of 1688, have proved increasingly meaningful
  as the Library becomes experienced in selecting related materials according
  to categories of desiderata worked out in collaboration with the faculty and
  tentatively set forth in the March 1958 issue of Needs. The books purchased
  fall broadly into the following classes: (1) Politics, Journalism, Religion;
  (2) Science, Philosophy, Economics, and (3) Belles Lettres, Music, Drama. The
  coherence of this collection is greater than it would appear from a mere listing.
  The units reinforce each other in innumerable ways, providing materials for
  a comprehensive study of a great transition age in the life and thought of men
  of English speech. In the field of political and religious controversy the largest
  number of items fall into the latter part of the reign of Charles and around
  the accession of William and Mary. Taking into account the library of Theological
  Seminary as well as our own collection, the body of original materials of this
  sort available here is impressive. Literary materials, where the Library is
  even stronger, have come more slowly. We have nevertheless added about twenty-five
  new plays in 1958-59, and we have been particularly successful in securing rare
  items in the related field of English music, including the Vocal scores of eight
  operas, the two parts of Henry Lawes's Ayres and Dialogues, 1653-55, and a copy
  of Thomas Mace's extraordinary treaties Musick's Monument, 1676. An unusual
  item in prose fiction is the picaresque Don Tomaso or the Juvenile Rambles of
  Thomas Dangerfield, 1680. Early science is represented by original editions
  of works by Boyle, Locke, Hobbes, Glisson, Charleton, Ray, Sprat, Merrit, POwer
  and Wallis. Among the major contributors to this project have been Bernard Kilgore,
  William H. Scheide '36, Robert H. Taylor '30, and Christian A. Zabriskie.</p>
<p><br>
  July 1958-June 1959</p>
<p>The establishment in the Princeton University Library of the John Foster Dulles
  '08 Library of Diplomatic History, centering around Mr. Dulles' papers, was
  announced in May, 1959. The Department of State and the University simultaneously
  made known an agreement concerning the establishment in the Library of a collection
  of microfilmed copies of official documents of the Department of State relating
  to Mr. Dulles' tenure as Secretary. His own personal papers were presented to
  the University by Mr. Dulles shortly before his death. The microfilms of the
  official documents will be physically located in the Dulles Library under approved
  safeguard conditions as prescribed by applicable laws and Executive Orders and
  will be subject to the same restrictions, limitations, and controls as are the
  original documents in the Department of State. Title and control of these copies
  will remain with the Federal Government until such time as all classification
  and restrictions have been removed from the originals. In giving his personal
  papers to Princeton as a research collection, Secretary Dulles declared that
  access to the papers, for the purpose of furthering bona fide research in the
  fields of history, political science, international relations, and related subjects,
  should be granted as widely as possible. Scholars seeking to consult these personal
  papers, once they have been completely organized and catalogued, must receive
  through the Library the written approval of a committee appointed by Mr. Dulles.</p>
<p>An important collection of papers of Edward Coles (1786-1868), second governor
  of Illinois and a noted early opponent of slavery, has been presented to the
  Library by George A. Robbins '20, Edward C. Robbins '22, James M. Robbins '26
  and Oliver W. Robbins. This new acquisition of some 400 pieces adds significantly
  to the Library's extensive manuscripts of American figures of the first half
  of the 19th century, containing as it does significant letters of James and
  Dolley Madison, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, Robert Fulton, Nicholas Biddle,
  Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster, and others.</p>
<p>An autograph collection numbering some 500 items has been presented by DeForest
  M. Alexander '24. Letters written to members of the Alexander family formed
  the basis of the collection, especially those received by the artist John White
  Alexander (1856-1915) and James W. Alexander, of the class of 1860. Numerous
  others of the autographs were collected from various sources by Henry Martyn
  Alexander '90, father of the donor. These are letters of Daniel Webster and
  Presidents Grant, Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, and Theodore Roosevelt. There are
  six letters of Samuel L. Clemens. Walt Whitman, William Dean Howells, Henry
  James, Thornton Wilder, and Gertrude Stein are represented. James McNeill Whistler
  is represented by six letters to John W. Alexander; other autographs of artists
  include those of Eastman Johnson, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, John La Farge, and
  Rodin. There are several letters of officers in both the Union and Confederate
  armies in the Civil War, of which six are addressed to General Robert E. Lee.
  There are autographs of persons prominently identified with Princeton, such
  as Joseph Henry, Arnold Guyot, Samuel Miller, Charles Hodge, Henry Van Dyke,
  and Presidents James Carnahan, James McCosh, Francis Landey Patton, and Woodrow
  Wilson. A group of nearly fifty Italian autographs in the collection includes
  those of notables from the 16th to the 19th century. There are also several
  English autographs, among which are letters of Robert Louis Stevenson, Thomas
  Hardy, and Alfred Noyes.</p>
<p>Papers of the late Ivy L. Lee '98, as well as some twelve hundred books from
  his library, have been presented by his sons, James W. Lee II '28, and Ivy L.
  Lee Jr. '31. A large body of papers of the author Philip Wylie '24 has been
  given by Mr. Wylie. James Gould Cozzens has added to the Cozzens Papers the
  corrected typescript and the corrected galley proofs of By Love Possessed, as
  well as more than 150 letters written to him by writers, publishers, critics,
  fans, and others, with carbons of his replies. Included in the correspondence,
  which covers the years 1933-1954, are letters from Louis Bromfield, Erskine
  Caldwell, Joyce Cary, Sidney Howard, and Oliver La Farge.</p>
<p><br>

  of Yoshio Osawa '25, has presented 413 volumes to the Library's Japanese collection
  as its contribution to the current $53 Million campaign of the University. This
  important gift has not only enriched the Japanese collection but also given
  a greater balance to the resources of the various subject fields.</p>
<p>The generosity of the Friends enabled the Library to purchase one of the ten
  special copies of the first American edition of Kipling's The Day's Work, distributed
  by Frank Doubleday to associates and containing portions of contributions to
  periodicals revised in the author's hand. A notable addition to the Library's

  the Chief of Sinners [by] John Bunyan (Boston: J. Allen for N. Boone, 1717),

  Fielding (Worcester: I. Thomas, 1799), edited from the first edition of six
  volumes to a mere 28p. A sampling of Mr. Hamilton's recent acquisitions of 19th

<p>MORRIS L. PARRISH COLLECTION OF VICTORIAN NOVELISTS. Through the generosity
  of Robert H. Taylor '30 and Mrs. Donald F. Hyde, the Library was able to acquire
  for the Parrish Collection a number of items from the Charles Dickens collection
  assembled by the late Compte Alain de Suzannet. Foremost among them is a copy
  of Dickens' printed circular letter on &quot;the wholesale piracy of British
  works&quot; in the United States, 1 Devonshire Terrace, York Gate, Regent's
  Park, Seventh July, 1842, addressed in the author's hand to C. Cowden Clarke.
  Also of interest are a copy of Songs, Choruses, and Concerted Pieces, in the
  Operatic Burletta of the Village Coquettes ([London]: Bradbury and Evans, 1837),
  in which the names of the singers are written in the margin next to their songs;
  and the Cheap Edition of The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club (London:
  Chapman and Hall, 1847), in the eight monthly parts. The other items acquired
  from the Suzannet collection are the following translations: Die Pickwickier
  (Leipzig, 1837-38), five volumes in three; Oliver Twist (Brunswick, 1838-79,
  in German, three volumes in one); Barnaby Rudge (Leipzig, 1841) in German, eight
  volumes in two; La Pleiade (Paris, 1842), containing &quot;Le Baron de Grogzwig&quot;
  from Nicholas Nickleby; Les Chefs-d'Oeuvre de Ch. Dickens (Paris, 1847); Les
  Contes de Ch. Dickens (Paris, 1847-53), in three volumes; Vie et Aventures de
  Martin Chuzzlewit (Pairs, 1858), in two volumes; Adventures de Monsieur Pickwick
  (Paris, 1859), in tow volumes; Le Neveu de ma Tante; Histoire Personelle de
  David Copperfield (Paris, 1859), in two volumes; Souvenirs de David Copperfield
  (Brussels [no date]), six volumes in two; Les Temps Difficiles (Paris [no date]);
  and Le Magasin d' Antiquit&#130;s (Paris, 1865). two volumes in one. Three additional
  translations of Dickens were obtained from another source: Nicholas Nickelby
  Lefnad och Afventyr (Stockholm, 1842), in three volumes; De Firma Dombey en
  Zoon (The Hague, 1847-48), two volumes in one; and David Copperfield den Yngres
  (Stockholm, [1852]), in three volumes.</p>
<p>The Library has long been interested in adding to the Collection translations,
  whether authorized or not, published during or shortly after the lifetime of
  the authors. Of the 24 other translations of various authors acquired during
  the year 1971-72 the following three are perhaps the most interesting: Charlotte
  Bront&#137;. Jane Eyre, Memoirs d'une Gouvernante (Brussels, 1849), two volumes
  in one; Wilkie Collins, Armadale (Stockholm, 1865-66), one volume in two, a
  translation in Swedish which precedes the first English edition (1866); and
  Mrs. Trollope, Zeden, Gewoonten en Huisselijk Leven der Noord-Amerikanen (Haarlem,
  1833), in two volumes. Other additions to the collection include Mrs. Trollope,
  The Mother's Manual (London, 1833), from the library of Princess Elizabeth,
  Landgravine of Hesse Homburg, with an inscription in her hand stating that the
  book had been given to her by the authoress on July 24, 1833, bound in alligator;
  Anthony Trollope's copy of Charles Lamb's Poetical Works (London, 1836); and
  a copy of the revised edition of Bulwer-Lytton, King Arthur (Toronto, 1871),

  24, 1880.</p>

  Recent Acquisitions</p>
<p>This past December, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur C. Holden gave the library their collection
  of one hundred and seventy books on the American Negro. The collection's main
  strength is in twentieth-century works on black literature, history, and sociology,
  but it also contains an interesting group of eighteenth and nineteenth-century
  books on blacks.</p>
<p>One pamphlet is the argument of a London attorney, Francis Hargrave, on behalf
  of a West Indian black, James Sommersett, in 1772. Hargrave's plea was successful
  and the victory established for the first time that blacks landing in England
  were free despite former servitude. Sommersett's case gave a significant boost
  to abolitionist morale in England. It also built enthusiasm in America, for
  the Hargrave pamphlet was reprinted in Boston two years later.</p>
<p>Another interesting eighteenth-century book in the Holden collection is the
  report of a New York judge on the proceedings resulting from the &quot;Negro
  Riot&quot; of 1741. At the time, New York was undergoing severe economic stress
  and was about twenty-percent black. As during any time of depression, thievery
  was frequent and a series of petty thefts led to a race riot. The trials were
  as grim as the riot. Thirteen slaves were burned alive, four whites and eighteen
  blacks were hanged, and over seventy others were banished. Even after the trials,
  tensions remained, so to dissolved doubts over the propriety of the proceedings,
  &quot;The Recorder of the City of New York&quot;, Daniel Hormansden, published
  anonymously in 1744, his Journal of the Proceedings in the Detection of the
  Conspiracy Formed By White People in Conjunction with Negro and other slaves,
  for Burning the City of New York in America, and Murdering the Inhabitants.
  Fear of a Negro conspiracy was not altogether relieved by the report, for Hormansden
  also prepared the report to persuade others of &quot;...the necessity there
  is for everyone that has negroes to kept a watchful eye over them and not to
  indulge in them with too great liberties which we find they make use of to the
  worse purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>Other interesting materials in the Holden gift are several abolitionist tracts,
  a small group of slave narratives, and a slave's manumission certificate dated
  at New York in 1814. Also found are a copy of the first collection of American
  Negro Spirituals, W.F.Allen's Slave Songs of the United States (NY, 1867) and
  one of the earliest comprehensive histories of blacks in America written by
  a black historian, William Wells Brown's The Rising Sun or the Antecedents and
  Advancements of the Colored People (Boston, 1874).</p>
<p>William Cowper</p>
<p>In 1962 the Library acquired the Nelson Campbell Hannay Collection of William
  Cowper, containing many Cowper letters together with a very large and strong
  gathering of his printed works. This past year the Library acquired an interesting
  copy of Cowper's Poems, published in London in two volumes. The first volume
  appeared in 1782 and the second in 1785. The Library's copy contains two rarely
  found, uncancelled leaves in the first volume and the unpublished preface to
  the Poems in the second.</p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the bibliographical particulars of this copy
  are interesting, but perhaps those for the preface are the most amusing as well
  as informative. The preface was prepared by Cowper's literary agent, John Newton,
  who had assisted Cowper with the publication of a number of earlier works. The
  publisher, John Johnson, however, was troubled by the preface, declaring it
  &quot;overserious and evangelical in tone.&quot; According to Cowper's bibliographer,
  Norma Russell, Librarian of Somerville College, Oxford, Johnson worried that
  it might hinder sale of the book and urged Cowper to withdraw it. &quot;Cowper
  at first stood out,&quot; writes Ms. Russell, &quot;but finally agreed to withdraw
  it only a week before publication when it was already printed.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to Princeton's copy, two others are known to have the preface.
  It is perhaps impossible to explain this fact, but the answer may lie in John
  Newton's memoirs. There he writes that &quot;if the purchases looked serious
  and methodical he probably was shown one with the preface, but promiscuous customers
  were not troubled by it.&quot;</p>
<p>Early Anthropology</p>
<p>In 1520, Hans Boehm, a German humanist, published a compilation of the manners
  and customs of all nations, his Repertorium...de omnium gentium ritibus. By
  organizing the information available about the laws and governments of other
  nations, Boehm hoped not only to inform his readers conveniently but also to
  improve their political conduct. The book was widely translated and later editions
  were enlarged with sections on the Indians in America. Today, the book is recognized
  as one of the earliest, if not first, attempts at scientific ethnology. For
  many years the Library has owned later editions of the work, but it was not
  until this past year that it acquired a copy of the first edition, which was
  presented in Augsburg. Princeton's copy was once in the library of Sir Leicester
  Harmsworth.</p>
<p>Hamilton Collection</p>
<p>In the first volume of Early American Book Illustrations and Wood Engravers
  1670 - 1870, Mr. Sinclair Hamilton described under the year 1717 a small pamphlet
  of ninety-two pages entitled A Dying Fathers Last Legacy to his Only Child:
  Or, Mr. Hugh Peter's advice to His Daughter... (Boston, 1717). The pamphlet
  contains a woodcut frontispiece portrait of the Reverend Hugh Peter and is signed
  &quot;J.F. Sculp.&quot; This portrait are thee other contemporary woodcuts have
  been attributed by both Lawrence C. Wroth and Clarence Brigham to James Franklin,
  brother of Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>Bloodgood Cutter</p>
<p>In Innocence Abroad, Mark Twain describes a man on tour as &quot;Poet Lariat&quot;
  of America.</p>
<p>&quot;...We have a poet and a good-natured enterprising idiot on board and
  [he does] distress the company. [He] gives copies of his verses to Consuls,
  commanders, hotel keepers, Arabs, Dutch - to any body, in fact, who will submit
  to a grievous infliction most kindly meant. His poetry is all very well on shipboard,
  notwithstanding when he wrote an 'Ode to the Ocean in a Storm' in one half hour,
  and an 'Apostrophe to the Rooster in the Waist of the Ship' in the next, the
  transition was considered to be rather abrupt; but when he sense an invoice
  of rhymes to the Governor of Fayal and another to the commander-in-chief and
  other dignitaries of Gibralter, with the compliments of the Laureate of the
  Ship, it is not popular with the passengers.&quot;</p>
<p>Twain's character was based on the colorful Long Island farmer named Bloodgood
  Cutter, whom some today might described as America's worst poet of any age.
  Cutter's poems were ready for any occasion: Sunday School picnics, clam bakes,
  visits of royalty, funerals, trials, and reflective moments over a wheel barrow.
  He enjoyed the publicity Twain gave and used the sobriquet &quot;Larriat&quot;
  on the title page of his first published book of poems.</p>
<p>This past year the Library secured three singly published poems by Cutter as
  additions to its small collection given by Elmer Adler. Winsome relices of popular
  culture in Victorian America, the poems are verses for a picnic, a visit of
  the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the arrival of &quot;Cleopatra's Needle&quot;
  in Central Park.</p>
<p>Flavius Josephus</p>
<p>In managing the Empire, Romans faced a number of colonial wars, some of which
  directed affected the course of politics at home. One such war was the Jewish
  War of A.D.66 through 73, whose hero, Vespasian, became the Emperor during his
  campaign in the East. What is known today about the Jewish War is based mainly
  upon the writings of Flavius Josephus. Originally a rebel Jewish commander,
  he became fiercely pro-Roman after his capture in A.D. 67.</p>
<p>Mr. Robert K. Porter has given the Library a copy of the first printed edition
  of Josephus' works. Published in Basle in 1544 by Froben, the edition was prepared
  by Arnoldus Paraxylus Arlenius. It was based on the manuscript belonging to
  Diego Hurtando de Mendoze, the Spanish collector whose library forms one of
  the main components of the Escorial.</p>
<p>Choderlos de Laclos</p>
<p>One of the most fascinating novels published in Paris immediately before the
  French Revolution is a collection of letters by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos entitled
  Les Liaisons Dangereuse ou Lettres recueilles dans une Societe et publiees pour
  l'instruction de quelques autres. Depicting a professional seducer and his victims
  in the upper classes, the book is regarded today as revolutionary as Beaumarchais'
  Marriage de Figaro. WHen first published in 1782, it went through sixteen different
  printings. Last fall, the Library received a copy of the first edition from
  Mr. Robert Taylor.</p>
<p>Thomas Hooker</p>
<p>Standing with Roger Williams and John Winthrop as a founder of New England
  is Thomas Hooker of Connecticut. A persuasive preacher and independent thinker,
  Hooker broke away from Massachusetts in 1636 and led his congregation from Newton
  into the Connecticut Valley. There he built a community based on free consent
  to authority, which scholars have identified as a landmark in the evolution
  of American democracy.</p>
<p>Hooker's ideas have given his writings a place in American literature. At auction
  in New England last winter, the Library acquired copies of two rare works, his
  Soules Humiliation (London, 1637) and Saints Dignitie and Dutie (London, 1651).</p>

<p>Recent Acquisitions - Books</p>
<p>The Graver and the Pen</p>
<p>In 1954, the staff of the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections
  of the Library mounted the first exhibition in this country ever devoted to
  &quot;Renaissance Emblems and their Ramifications.&quot; The show marked a turning
  point in the study of emblems at Princeton and established the Library as a
  major center for their study. It was based almost entirely on emblem books in
  the collections of the Library.</p>
<p>Since 1954, the emblem book collection has continued to grow and this year
  we added nearly twenty others, including some from the great collector of emblem
  books, Sir William Stirling-Maxwell.</p>
<p>In connection with collecting, we are preparing, together with Prof. William
  Heckscher, formerly at Duke University, a census of emblem books. Tentatively
  titled The Princeton Emblem Biography, the census will identify, first, all
  emblem books in the Princeton libraries, and, eventually, provide a listing
  of emblem books held by all libraries in North America. In addition to providing
  a transcription of the title page and details of the collation, each entry will
  carry a record of the artists, translators, editors, commentators, patrons,
  and other persons associated with the book's production. The census will also
  contain a comprehensive index covering the forms and subjects found in each
  emblem book.</p>
<p>Work on the census has been proceeding steadily since January, 1977, and has
  necessarily been concentrated on the first and one of the most widely published
  emblematists of the Renaissance, Andrea Alciati. At present, we are drawing
  on the Princeton collection along for bibliographical data, and would welcome
  from our readers contributions of information concerning emblem books and their
  whereabouts, literature pertaining to them, and emblem manuscripts.</p>
<p>Vergil:</p>
<p>This past year the Library's collection of Vergil was enriched with two gifts.
  Through the generosity of Arthur W. Machen '42,we received the Robert Hoe copy
  of the 1501 Aldine edition of Vergil's works. Given in memory of Arthur W. Machen
  (1827-1915), the donor's grandfather, and of his father, Arthur W. Machen (1877-1950),
  the book was purchased by the elder Mr. Machen at Part II of the Hoe sale conducted
  by Anderson Auction Co. on the afternoon of January 19, 1912. Several letters
  between Mr. Machen and his New York agent accompany the gift and tell us, among
  other details, that Bernard Quaritch was the underbidder for the Vergil. The
  copy is very clean and was bound at the Club Bindery in full red levant morocco
  with gauffered gilt edges.</p>
<p>It bears repeating that the 1501 Aldine Vergil holds two important places in
  the history of Western printing. On the one hand, it marks the first appearance
  of italic type, and, on the other, its small octavo format established a fashion
  for the small book. Through the gifts of Robert H. Taylor '30 and Henry E. Gerstly
  '20, we have acquired the first Paris edition of Vergil's works, printing in
  1498 by Ulrich Gerig and Bertold Rembolt. This edition of Vergil's is not listen
  in F.R. Goff's Incunabula in American Libraries nor the Catalogue of Books Printed
  in the XVth Century Now in the British Museum. The only other copy known appears
  to be that at the Bodleian Library, Oxford.</p>
<p>The Constitutions of the States:</p>
<p>A Princeton book has come back to Princeton. This past year the Library has
  purchased a copy of the Constitutions of Several Independent States of America
  which was published in Philadelphia by order of Congress in 1781. The task of
  publication was assigned in December 1780 to Thomas Bee, John Witherspoon, and
  Oliver Wolcott to &quot;collect and cause to be published 200 current copies
  of the Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, Treaties between
  France and America and the Constitutions of the States.&quot; It was the first
  time that the state constitutions were issued together. On page 100 of our copy
  appears the signature of George Morgan. A comparison of this signature with
  the letters and diaries of George Morgan, Colonel in the Revolution, Indian
  agent, and proprietor of the farm Prospect in Princeton until 1796, shows that
  this copy of Constitutions was Morgan's. The book is bound in a well-preserved
  contemporary American binding of mottled calf with floral decorations on the
  spine, evidently done by James Leishman of Trenton.</p>
<p>A Renaissance Encyclopedia:<br>
  Of the several book collectors in Princeton's Class of 1888, the best known
  are Morris L. Parrish and Junius Spencer Morgan. From the collection of their
  classmate, Archibald Robertson Osmer, the Library received in May an immaculate
  incunable, given in his memory by his son, Gilbert G. Osmer '20. Beautifully
  bound in quarter leather pigskin over oak boards, the book is the Venice, 1497
  edition of the standard one-volume encyclopedia of that day, the Catholicon
  of Johannes Balbus.</p>
<p>Hamilton Gifts:</p>
<p>Several Gifts have come this past year from Sinclair Hamilton '06 for the Library's
  collections of American and European illustrated books. Among the most outstanding
  are a copy of the first appearance of James Greenleaf Whittier's &quot;The Barefoot
  Boy&quot; in the January 1855 issue of The Little Pilgrim as well as a magnificent
  copy of Ulrich Pinder's Speculum Passionis (Nuremberg, 1507). The Speculum is
  considered one of the outstanding achievements of German book illustration in
  the early sixteenth century. It contains seventy-six woodcuts of the Passion
  of Christ, thirty-nine of which are full-page. The cuts are by Hans Schaufelein
  , Hans Baldung Grun and Hans von Kulmbach. It is believed that Schaufelein's
  work in this book was influenced by Albrecht Durer and may in turn have affected
  Durer's work.</p>
<p>War between the Noun and the Verb</p>
<p>In 1511, Andreas Guara's Bellum grammaticale appeared explaining grammar as
  a royal battle between two kings - the Noun and the Verb. The witty book was
  an immediate success, being reprinted five times in 1512, and another three
  in 1514. Eventually it reached 100 separate editions by the end of the eighteenth
  century and was translated into French, English, Italian, German, and Swedish.
  Oxford students rewrote it as a play perhaps as early as 1590 but certainly
  by 1635. In March, the Library acquired a copy of the first edition published
  in Cremona.</p>
<p>Wilder Gift:</p>
<p>Added to our collections is a gift from Miss Isabel Wilder. The book is her
  brother's presentation copy of The Bridge of San Luis Rey (London, 1927) and
  is inscribed: &quot;For Isabel: With all my best. Thornton. On the flyleaf facing
  the title page Wilder recorded some particulars concerning his writing it:</p>

<p>Recent Acquisitions - Books</p>
<p><br>
  Last May, the Library acquired as its three-millionth printed book a small volume
  of early American verse. Published in New London, Connecticut by Timothy Green
  in 1725, the book is the first volume of verse printed in the colony. Entitled
  Poetical Meditation, Being the Improvement of SOme Vacant Hours, the book is
  by Roger Wolcott a colorful character who held numerous public offices in Connecticut,
  including service as governor of the colony from 1750 to 1754. Wolcott was in
  many ways a self-made man of the frontier and his Poetical Meditations is a
  collection of attempts at sacred poetry and heroic verse. The longest poem is
  more than thirteen hundred lines, being, ironically, &quot;A Brief Account of
  the Agency of the Honourable John Winthrop, Esq, in the Court of King Charles
  the Second, Anno Dom. 1602. When he obtained for the Colony of Connecticut His
  Majesty's Gracious Charter.&quot; At the end of the book is an unusual three-page
  advertisement signed by Joseph Dewey, a man &quot;imployed in the Making and
  Working of Cloth.&quot; Dewey advises that he paid for at least some of the
  publishing costs of Wolcott's Poetical Meditations and, continuing in the reflective
  mood of the book, he offers seven rules to insure better made and longer lasting
  clothing. His advice was of no small consequence at the time, since wills and
  inventories of this period show that clothing was among a man's most costly
  possessions and important enough to be bequeathed to one's heirs.</p>
<p>As well as being the three-millionth accession, the book was also bought as
  an official memorial to William S. Dix, University Librarian from 1953 to 1975,
  whose scholarly interest was in the field of American literature. In addition
  to purchasing this book in memory of Mr. Dix, the Library has also established
  a book fund from one hundred and thirty separate contributors. At present, the
  fund has accumulated more than eighteen thousand dollars in capital and is still
  open to contributions from all of our interested readers.</p>

  in 1939, at the exhibition at the Grolier Club in 1947, at the Princeton Exhibition
  in 1951, and on many other occasions. An exhibition devoted entirely to her
  work was held at the Argent Galleries at 42 W. 57th Street, New York City, in
  1949. Specimens of her bindings will be found in the New York Public Library
  (Spencer Collection), the Princeton University Library, Pierpont Morgan Library
  in New York, Harvard College Library, Dartmouth College Library, the Library
  of the Grolier club, NYC, Columbia University LIbrary and the University of
  Pittsburgh (Frick Fine Arts Dept.).</p>

  fine bindings are illustrated.</p>

<p>Recent Acquisitions - Books:</p>
<p>During the past academic year (1982-1983), the Library acquired by purchase
  for the General Rare Book Collections well over 1,100 books. Their range in
  subject matter is great. As in past years, they reflect the areas in which the
  rare book collections are strongest, namely, English and American literature
  and history. Added to these purchases were 184 gifts of various sorts, the most
  outstanding of which is the gift of many 18th-century French belletristic works
  from teh library of the late Professor Ira O. Wade. A survey of the numerous
  acquisitions reveals the following categories of purchases: poetical miscellanies
  of the 18th-century England; emblem books; 17th-century English plays; several
  outstanding first editions of the Danish existentialist philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard;
  translations of Russian novels into English; European social history; literature
  relating to the English stage in the 18th and 19th centuries; rare books on
  the Near East; history of science; modern Latin American literature; Edwardian
  novels; and books of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>In many ways, these current acquisitions reflect the very nature of the General
  Rare Book Collections; they are a microcosm of the enormously varied University
  Library Collectios. Indeed, the totality of the special sub-collections within
  the General Rare Book Collections is yet to be determined, but we do know from
  out recently completed Guide to Selected Special Collections of Printed Books
  and Other Materials in the Princeton Univeristy Library that their number is
  nearly 200. This past year, as in other years, we have tried to add to some
  of these sub-groupings, but our desire to do so is always controlled by availability
  of both funds and books, to name only two limitations.</p>
<p>Since the academic year 1979-1980, the Library has been a member of the Research
  Libraries Group and consequently has been utilizing its automated shared cataloguing
  system, called RLIN (Research Libraries Information Network). Records for all
  the recent acquisitions acquired for the General Rare Book Collections are now
  found in RLIN.</p>
<p>The following are only some of the year's more outstanding acquisitions.</p>
<p>Americana</p>
<p>We continue to add to our collection of the printed works of selected contemporary
  Latin American authors, a collecting program begun in conjunction with teh Manuscript
  Division's effort to acquire the papers of several leading contemporary authors.
  This year we added books by Jose Donoso, Reinaldo Arenas, Carlos Fuentes, and
  Guillermo Cabrera Infante.</p>
<p>In 1974 we received as a gift from Mrs. Gerard B. Lambert an object long used
  in the New World for the recording of events and the keeping of accounts. It
  is called a quipu and consists of a bundle of knotted cords. It was used by
  the Incas between the 13th and 15th centuries and was recorded to be in use
  in the 19th century in the interior of Peru and Bolivia. This year we added
  a study of the quipu published in Naples in 1750. The circumstances of its publicatio
  make a long story indeed, since the book was written as a defense of a work
  claiming to have been translated from quipus. The defender was a learned Neopolitan
  inventor and linguist, Raimondo Sangro (1710-1771), and his book includes several
  plates printed in color demonstrating knots for &quot;master words,&quot; Peruvian
  songs, and so forth.</p>
<p>Also in the area of Americana, we have added Heinrich Alting's Theologia eleuctica
  nova (Amsterdam, 1654), once in the library of Jonathan Edwards, theologian
  and president of Princeton at the time of his death in 1758. The Library already
  owns nearly 60 books once belonging to Edwards.</p>
<p>We have also added the subscription proposals for printing an 18th-century
  ethnography of American Indians by a Scotsman, David Doig, who had been Deputy
  Provost Marshal General Commander in West Florida. The projected book, The Manners
  and Customs of the American Indians, was evidently never published. The proposals
  have been unrecorded heretofore, and they contain reports of numerous circumstances
  of Doig's 23-year residence in America.</p>
<p>Thaddeus Burr Wakeman, Class of 1854.</p>
<p>During the early part of 1983, the greater portion of the library of a late
  19th-century Baltimore ship captain, James H. Graff, became available on the
  antiquarian book market. His library consisted of more than 330 &quot;yellowbacks&quot;
  (now in the hands of a Philadelphia bookseller) as well as a gathering pf books
  on socialist and radical political themes. From the latter group, the Library
  recently acquired seven books, including one by a member of the Princeton Class
  of 1854, Thaddeus Burr Wakeman. Born in Connecticut, Wakeman came from a staunch
  Presbyterian family and evidently was expected to enter the ministry. At graduation,
  he declared he could not do so, and instead he read law in a New York City law
  office. He was admitted to the bar in 1856 and practiced in New York City for
  many years. Instead of theology, his mind turned to politcal thought and religious
  free thinking. A newspaper obituary declared him &quot;one of the most advanced
  advocates of liberalism in this country.&quot; His early politics were anti-slavery,
  and after the war he was a follower of Horace Greeley. After 1868, he was active
  in Free Thought movements in New York; leader in the Humanity Society; president
  of the Manhattan Libreral Club; and president of the National Liberal League
  and the New York State Free Thinker's League. He was editor of Man, a liberal
  journal, as well as the Torch of Reason. Wakeman was knwon for his oratorical
  skills (he was a perennial convention speaker, according to one historian).
  The book recently acuired is Wakeman's address before the Committee on Charitable
  and Religious Societies of the Assembly of the State of New York on March 23,
  1881. Entitled Liberty and Purity: How to Secure both Safely, Effectively, and
  Impartially, it was delivered in opposition to a bill to increase the powers
  of the Society for the Suppression of Vice, which had succeeded in establishing
  the Comstock Postal Laws which aimed at excluding all mail &quot;designed to
  incite lust.&quot;</p>
<p>Wakeman was a controversial character, no doubt, and it is interesting to observe
  that only one of his 24 books is found today in the Library's Princtoniana or
  so-called &quot;P&quot; collection. The &quot;P&quot; collection gathered books,
  pamphlets, autograph albums, bound manuscripts, and pictures relating to Princeton
  and its alumni. The earliest known date of existence for the &quot;P&quot; collection
  is 1905. At that time it amounted to 3585 volumes, including the large collection
  of Princetoniana presented by Professor William Libbey, Class of 1877. Active
  collecting stopped about 1948. In the collection, some Princeton writers, such
  as Booth Tarkington and John Witherspoon, are well represented, but Wakeman's
  works are conspicuously lacking.</p>
<p>Restoration and other Seventeeth-Century English Plays:</p>
<p>The Library has been diligently collecting the English Restoration and other
  17th-century plays the 1930s. Records of the early collection are nonexistent,
  but our knowledge of acquisitions make during the past 20 years is quite complete.
  Since 1963, the Library has added 176 plays to the existing collection of about
  700 volumes. During that 20-year period, the rate of acquisition has averaged
  about eight plays per year. This past academic year, we collected a bonanza
  of more than twice our usual fund - 17 plays to be exact. To us this seems extraordinary,
  in light of the fact that a recent specialized antiquarian dealer's catalogue
  listed 116 Restoration plays, and we had them all! The titles of the plays reflect
  many of the political and social interests of the day, such as the Glorious
  Revolution (The Late Revolution: Or, The Happy Change. A Tragi-Comedy, As it
  was acted throughout the English Dominions in the Year 1688. London, 1690. Wing
  L558); love and marriage; and religion.</p>
<p>Edwardian Novels</p>
<p>In the spring 1981 issue of the Library Chronicle we announced the purchase
  of a collection of Edwardian novels. During the past academic year, this collection
  has been completely catalogued on RLIN under a grant from the United States
  government as part of the Higher Education Act, Title II-C. This past year we
  purchased from a Philadelphia bookseller another collection of Edwardian novels
  consisting of many titles that augmented the holdings of the authors' works
  included in the 1981 purchase. Also rounding out this year's purchases are many
  novels by women authors. Again under Title II-C, cataloguing of this recently
  acquired collected of 667 volumes has been completed. The cataloguing was based
  on the processing of the 1981 purchase, thus allowing a considerable saving
  of time and effort.</p>
<p>English Poetical Miscellanies</p>
<p>Recently purchased from a Princeton bookseller is a collection of English poetical
  miscellanies published between 1625 and 1800. In its entirety, the collection
  consists of 86 titles in 71 volumes. These 86 join more than 200 other editions
  of English poetical miscellanies for the same period already in the Library.
  Although it is not known exactly when the Library began to gather these miscellanies,
  impetus for collecting them came in 1935 when the first comprehensive bibliography
  of English poetical miscellanies was published. The Princeton copy of Case shows
  intensive use by the Associate Librarian, Lawrence Hely, as he began to search
  and purchase miscellanies for our growing collections. Mr. Heyl not only annotated
  entries for copies held by Princeton but also noted variations of Princeton
  copies with the published descriptions.</p>
<p>Miscellany, as a term meaning a collection of literary works gathered together
  in one volume, was first used in 1638. Nonetheless, poetical miscellanies had
  existed in ENgland at least since 1557m the year in which Richard Tottel published
  his famous Songs and Sonnettes, written by the ryght honorable Lorde Henry Haward
  late Early of Surrey and other, today known as Tottel's Miscellany. In fact,
  some claim that the London, 1532 edition of Chaucer's Works ought to be called
  the first English poetical miscellany since it contains some 20 pieces not by
  Chaucer. In any event, since they first appeared, poetical miscellanies were
  enormously popular in England. Their popularity is evidenced by the large hunber
  of miscellany editions issued under the same title both during Elizabethan times
  and afterwards. (Tottel's Miscellany alone went through nine editions between
  1557 and 1587. Many of these editions were completely read to pieces; in some
  cases, proof of their existence is based on only one surviving copy.) In addition,
  titles of miscellanies proliferated, with about 85 per year being issued at
  the end of the 18th century.</p>
<p>The role of poetical miscellanies in English literary life is only partly understood.
  They sometimes contained the first appearance of an author's work. Notable examples
  are the publication of Alexander Pope's first poetical work in volume six of
  Tonson's Poetical Miscellanies (London, 1709), or playwright Nathaniel Lee's
  first publication in Musarum Catabrigiensium Threnodia (Cambridge, 1670). Another
  example, as well, is that of Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, nee Kingsmill
  (1666?-1720). Her Pindaric ode, The Spleen, was first published in A New Miscellany
  in 1701. A fourth example in John Locke's first appearance in print, a poem
  in John Owen's Musarum Oxoniensium, published at Oxford in 1654. Indeed, the
  foundation stone of any collection of English romantic poetry - Lyrical Ballads,
  a collection of poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge (Bristol, 1798) - from one
  point of view looks entirely like a kind of poetical miscellany. Like other
  miscellanies, none of the poems is signed (many are now famous, such as &quot;The
  Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; and &quot;Lines written a few miles above
  Tintern Abbey&quot;) and no editor's name appears on the title page.</p>
<p>What a modern scholar says of Elizabethan miscellanies is true for all:</p>
<p>Yet modern readers...are surprisingly unfamiliar with the miscellanies, and
  no bibliography has yet recorded their full number without omission or error.
  Their varied interests for present scholars remain largely unexplored. The collections
  shed light on he history of taste and on the directions of change in poetic
  theme and technique. Their story reveals the practices of a flourishing book
  trade and patterns of imitation and interaction between poets and poetic types.
  Literary conventions passed in and out of their development, shaping one volume
  or filling out substance in another. Yet of the many questions they raise, only
  one, perhaps the least fruitful, has been pursued at all: identification of
  the authors of the many anonymous poems. The miscellanies have not been assessed
  as a phenomenon or as a form; nor have their gatherings of poetry been studied
  in particular literary contexts.</p>
<p>Addenda:</p>
<p>&quot;Wit's Descant on any Plain-song&quot;: 17th-Century English Character
  Books</p>
<p>Character is a complicated concept stemming from the Greek word meaning &quot;to
  scratch&quot;. Such a graphic, literal meaning has given way to the many figurative
  uses common today - the distinguishing traits of an object; the qualities of
  the human personality; one's reputation; an odd or eccentric person; a &quot;character&quot;
  actor; the behavior of a moral or immoral person.</p>
<p>Some writers of 17th-century England focused on these concepts and a number
  developed a literary genre called &quot;a character.&quot; Collections of these
  short descriptions of types of individuals were known as character books. They
  wrapped in a shrewdly persuasive rhetoric worldly wisdom, moral insight, satiric
  observation, humor, and entertainment. Today they seem to have few counterparts,
  but perhaps the newspaper cartoon or The Preppy Handbook comes closest to the
  spirit of the character book.</p>
<p>The work of the Greek writer Theophrastus served as the model for the earliest
  English character books. He was first translated into English in 1616, and has
  remained available in English in varying editions down to the present. These
  early translations of Theophrastus were generalized &quot;type&quot; portraits
  intended to personify abstract concepts. At the outbreak of the Civil War, so-called
  &quot;controversial&quot; characters appeared, usually as eight-page pamphlets
  in quatro format. Unlike &quot;type&quot; portraits, &quot;controversial&quot;
  characters had a particular focus but left their subject unnamed. In 1675, there
  was a small and successful outrush of quatro format &quot;type&quot; characters,
  but these were overtaken by a wave of &quot;controversial&quot; broadside and
  folio characters in 1680 - 83. These related directly to the Popish plot, religious
  controversy, and political infighting. Thereafter the character book appeared
  less frequently until the Glorious Revolution of 1688 inspired a brief outburst
  (1688 - 1691). In the subsequent early years of the 18th century, Ned Ward reverted
  to the &quot;type&quot; character book in his works on the army and navy that
  were frequently reprinted.</p>
<p>Because of the specific circumstances surrounding the writing and publishing
  of character books, these intriguing half-sheet broadsides, four and eight-page
  pamphlets are extremely scarce today. In 1982 the Library had the remarkable
  fortune to acquire 55 of them. Most are known in only one or two copies, and
  a great majority of them date from the 1680s.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas More</p>
<p>In November 1980, the Library received a collection of early printed books
  by and about Sir Thomas More. Beheaded in 1535 and declared a saint in 1935
  - quite a while later, More was a complex man whose central role in the rise
  of the English nation makes him a fascinating individual for many collectors.
  The gift is the collection of Canon F. Sidney Bancroft of the Class of 1927,
  who began collecting More many years ago.</p>
<p>The collection includes more than 125 volumes, of which 42 were printed during
  the era of the hand press. These 42 include many editions of Utopia, including
  a translation into French published in 1643. The earliest edition of Utopia
  in Canon Bancroft's collection is one printed at London in 1543. The Library
  already has the first edition of Utopia (Louvain, 1516) and the Bancroft collection
  greatly augments our holdings of subsequent editions.</p>
<p>The facts about More's life have been manipulated in the past to serve the
  needs of political ideology or religious opinion. Evidently with such a fact
  in mind, Canon Bancroft collected several of the important early biographies
  of More, including an early edition of the biography by Thomas Stapleton, the
  recusant of New College, Oxford. Stapleton's Tres Thomae translated Roper's
  English work into Latin and added other material. The biography by Cresacre
  More, Sir Thomas' great grandson, published in 1642, borrowed from both Roper
  and Stapleton. To the narrative, Cresacre More added stories of the &quot;decorative
  miracles&quot; as the Encyclopedia Britannica (11th edition) puts it.</p>

  of a fainter impression than I have seen. Some child, the curse of antiquaries
  and bane of bibliopolical rarities, hath been dabbling in some of them with
  its paint and dirty fingers, and in particular hath a little sullied the author's
  own portraiture, which I think valuable, as the poem that accompanies it is
  no common one; this last excepted, the Emblems are far inferior to old Quarles.
  I once told you otherwise, but I had not then read old Q. with attention. I
  have pickt up too another copy of the Quarles for ninepence!!! O tempora! O
  lectores! so that if you have lost or parted with your own copy, say so, and

  last and greatest work, considered to be the first modern textbook of physics

  Foundation and as a Trustee of Princeton University, December 1990. Signed on
  titlepage: C:Baltemore. This &quot;C:Baltemore&quot; may well be one of two

  his son, the third Lord Baltimore, Charles Calvert (1639-1715). The Princeton
  University Library holds a 1683 document signed by the third Lord Baltimore
  and the signature on that document shows close similarity to that on the title
