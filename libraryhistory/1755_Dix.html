SAMUEL DAVIES, fourth president
  of the college at Princeton, began the preface to the first printed catalogue
  of the college library, which he himself compiled, as follows: </span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>A large and well-sorted Collection of Books on the
  various Branches of Literature, is the most ornamental and useful Furniture
  of a College, and the most proper and valuable Fund with which it can be endowed.
  It is one of the best Helps to enrich the Minds both of the Officers and Students
  with Knowledge; to give them an extensive Acquaintance with Authors; and to
  lead them beyond the narrow Limits of the Books to which they are confined in
  their stated Studies and Recitations, that they may expatiate at large thro'
  the boundless and variegated Fields of Science. If they have Books always at
  Hand to consult upon every Subject that may occur to them, as demanding a more
  thoro' Discussion, in their public Disputes, in the Course of their private
  Studies, in Conversation, or their own fortuitous Tho'ts; it will enable them
  to investigate TRUTH thro' her intricate Recesses; and to guard against the
  Stratagems and Assaults of Error: It will teach them Modesty and Self-Diffidence,
  when they perceive the free and different Sentiments of Men equally great and
  good….<a href="#_edn1"
name="_ednref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>On September 27, 1759, at the first meeting of the
  Trustees after Davies had arrived in Princeton and taken up his presidential
  duties, the Minutes record, &quot;That President Davies be desired as soon as
  he conveniently can to take a Methodical Catalogue of the Books in the College
  Library, and order the same to be printed at the Expense of the College.&quot;<a
href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>  The fact that the
  catalogue was completed and printed under the date of January 29, 1760, just
  four months after the instructions of the Trustees, may suggest the high priority
  the young president gave to this library project. </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>This prefatory statement to the Catalogue of 1760
  not only sounded a persistent and dominant theme of the educational theory upon
  which the little college was based and upon which it operated throughout most
  of the century, but it was also surely the most direct and forthright manifesto
  of the role of the library in the academic process that was published in America
  in the eighteenth century.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span> [3]
  </span></a>  Although its style is of its century, with Miltonic overtones from
  the seventeenth century, its emphasis upon independent study, intellectual freedom,
  and the integration of the library with the teaching program seems thoroughly
  modern. This proclamation of the importance of the library and its role is so
  remarkable that some inquiry into its origins, both in the history of the college
  and in Davies's own background, seems a good starting point for a history of
  the Princeton University Library. </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>A brief chronology may help keep the facts in order.
  The college was opened in May of 1747 under the provisions of a charter granted
  in 1746 under Acting Governor Hamilton. Its origins lay in the rising demand
  for a college of genuine quality to fill the need both for broadly educated
  men in the learned professions and for scholarly ministers of the gospel in
  the pastorates of the Middle Colonies and the developing regions to the south
  and west. Its purposes were outlined in this order in a statement prepared for
  a fund-raising trip to Britain in 1752:  &quot;It will suffice to say that the
  two principal Objectives the Trustees had in view, were Science and Religion.
  Their first Concern was to cultivate the Minds of the Pupils, in all those Branches
  of Erudition, which are generally taught in the Universities abroad; and to
  perfect their Design, their next Care was to rectify the Heart, by inculcating
  the great Precepts of Christianity, in order to make them good Men.&quot;<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span>
  [4] </span></a> </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jonathan Dickinson, pastor
  of the First Presbyterian Church in Elizabeth Town, New Jersey, was elected
  the first president and taught the eight or ten students temporarily in his
  own parsonage in the hope that permanent buildings could soon be erected in
  Princeton, which had already been tentatively selected as an appropriately central
  and salubrious location. In<b> </b>spite of this concern for health, the first
  five presidents were to die in office within fourteen years, President Dickinson
  having died of pleurisy within a few months after his inauguration, the Reverend
  Aaron Burr took over the leadership of the little college in the fall of 1747
  and moved it to his parsonage in Newark.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>After a variety of vigorous efforts, with particular
  assistance from Governor Jonathan Belcher, who had secured a revised and sounder
  charter, sufficient funds were raised to construct Nassau Hall and the President's
  House.  In<b> </b>November of 1756 the President and the students, now numbering
  about seventy, moved to the permanent home of the college in Princeton.  President
  Burr, the importance of whose services to the college has still not been adequately
  recognized, did not live long enough to enjoy the new and commodious quarters.
  He died in the early fall of 1757, soon after preaching Governor Belcher's funeral
  sermon, and was succeeded by Jonathan Edwards.  That great theologian and phi-
  losopher, who had been an advisor of his son-in-law Burr on college matters,
  had just arrived in Princeton when he died in March of 1758 of a smallpox inoculation.
</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edwards was succeeded,
  after some disagreement in the Board and some reluctance on the part of the
  nominee, by Samuel Davies, who, at the request of the Trustees, had undertaken
  an arduous but successful fund-raising journey to Britain about five years earlier
  and who, at 36, was probably the most famous pulpit orator in America. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Davies in his turn lasted
  only eighteen months as president, dying in February of 1761 after a productive
  if brief term of office, The Reverend Samuel Finley, who had been head of the
  well-known academy of Nottingham, was elected to follow Davies. Finley's term
  of five years was one of general growth for the college, the number of students
  having risen to 120 by 1764.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whether the death in office
  of five presidents in less than fifteen years made them seek tougher stock or
  whether it was thought that the appointment of a distinguished foreigner might
  help close the rift in the American Presbyterian church, the Trustees decided
  </span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>to offer the presidency to John Witherspoon, pastor
  at Paisley in Scotland and already a leader in the Scottish church. After a
  trans-atlantic courtship, he was finally persuaded to accept.  He arrived in
  Princeton in August of 1768, and until his death in 1794 he led the college
  with determination and vigor through the difficult times of Revolution and postwar
  recovery, quickly acquiring a role of political leadership to parallel his leadership
  in educational and theological matters. At the same time that he was active
  in the struggle for independence, he made Princeton the center of intellectual
  currents that helped mold the philosophy of the new nation. </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Witherspoon's son-in-law, Samuel Stanhope Smith,
  succeeded him in May of 1795. His administration marked the transition to the
  new century in spirit as well as in chronology.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span>
  [5] </span></a> </p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%;
'><span style='font-size:26.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>*</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>The origins of Princeton were doubly rooted in dissent.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span>
  [6] </span></a>  The ministers of the gospel who founded the college, like the
  founders of Harvard and Yale, had, of course, many points of disagreement with
  the established church, the Church of England, in theology and in ecclesiastical
  government. The founders of Princeton, in addition, perceived a need for the
  new college because, as New Lights, they differed from the more conservative
  Old Lights of the Presbyterian church.'<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span>
  [7] </span></a>  As Richard Hofstadter and Wilson Smith point out, &quot;Byand
  large the early colleges were set up to propagate the orthodoxies of their denominations
  and communities…&quot; but &quot;a new note, imposed by the interdenominational
  politics of New Jersey, was struck in the Princeton charter:  students could
  not be excluded from or discriminated against in college because of their religion.&quot;<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8"
title=""><span> [8] </span></a>  For these reasons the intellectual climate at
  Princeton in its colonial period was a little different from that at the other
  colleges. </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>The Charter of 1746, noting that &quot;the said Petitioners
  have also expressed their earnest Desire that those of every Religious Denomination
  may have free and Equal Liberty and Advantage of Education in the Said College
  notwithstanding any different Sentiments in Religion,&quot; established the
  structure of the college laws, &quot;not excluding any Person of any religious
  Denomination whatsoever from free and Equal Liberty and Advantage of Education,
  or from any of the Liberties, Privileges or immunities of the Said College on
  account of his or their <i>speculative Sentiments in Religion and of his, or
  their </i>being of a Religious profession Different from the said Trustees of
  the College.&quot;<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span> [9] </span></a>
  In<b> </b>the Charter of 1748, a revision of the earlier Charter of 1746, the
  italicized words were dropped, perhaps because the word &quot;speculative&quot;
  seemed needlessly provocative. Both charters are surprisingly liberal. Not always
  are those who<i> </i>have battled for their own freedom, particularly in matters
  theological, so ready to extend a measure of freedom to others.<a href="#_edn10"
name="_ednref10" title=""><span> [10] </span></a> </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>The founders of Princeton and many of their associates,
  mostly Presbyterian clergymen, were uncommon men.  To come to grips with them
  as persons it is necessary to get rid of certain stereotypes. Perhaps it was
  the age of the Volstead Act that evoked the image of the Protestant preacher
  as a blue-nosed killjoy, fanatical and illiterate. Perhaps the typical minister
  did become a different sort of person in the great wave of religious change
  that swept over America in the early decades of the nineteenth century. At any
  rate, these eighteenth-century Presbyterians do not fit the later image.</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Any notion that they may have been teetotallers vanishes
  immediately if one glances at the innkeeper's bill for a college function.<a
href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span> [11] </span></a>  They had no
  difficulty in accepting the lottery five times as a legitimate device for college
  fund raising.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span> [12] </span></a>
  Nor were these men earnest but uncultured backwoods evangelists, as some practitioners
  of other sects were<i>. </i>Aaron Burr, the second President, was the head of
  a struggling little college in the colonies with only a handful of students.
  Yet he could write in terms of easy familiarity to Philip Doddridge, perhaps
  the most famous of the English Dissenting ministers, urging him to use his influence
  at Court lest Jonathan Belcher, a friend of the college, lose his office to
  Chief Justice Morris, who was seeking the post and who<i> </i>might be less
  friendly. &quot;So that whatever you do to support his Excellency's Interest
  at the Court of Great Britain will be a very acceptable Service to Church and
  State…In<b> </b>the present state of Affairs Tis of more Consequence to the
  Interest of Religion to have a good Governor in the Jerseys than any of the
  other Provinces.&quot;<a
href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span> [13] </span></a> </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>A little later, anticipating the death of the ailing
  Governor and believing that his son, Jonathan, Chief Justice of Halifax, would
  be a worthy successor, he wrote to the Reverend George Whitefield, &quot;If
  you could by the Marquiss [sic]<i> </i>of Lothian, Lady Huntington or any other
  of your Friends at Court forward that Matter you would do a most Acceptable
  piece of service to all your Friends here and indeed to the whole Province.”<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14"
title=""><span> [14] </span></a></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Yet at the same time that Burr could deal with imperial
  politics with this assurance, he was himself attending to the whole range of
  duties that went with the management of a small, rather isolated, understaffed
  boarding college, as his account book indicates.<a href="#_edn15"
name="_ednref15" title=""><span> [15] </span></a>  It records tuition, paid and
  not paid, textbooks bought and sold to students, even shoes and articles of
  clothing provided.  The President of the College of New Jersey before the Revolution
  obviously had to be international diplomat, teacher, spiritual advisor and counselor
  <i>in loco parentis</i>, business manager, bookseller – and librarian.</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Burr and many of his associates in the formative
  years of the college were indeed deeply religious preachers.  Their interest
  in the young college was in a literal sense a consuming one.  They were in addition
  broadly learned, politically sophisticated men of affairs.  Bernard Bailyn has
  characterized the importance of the clergymen in the cultural life of the colonies:
  “For the vast majority of Americans it was the clerics who provided the continuing
  contacts with the explicit, articulate cultural inheritance.  They were the
  main agents of transmission, and the way in which they fulfilled this role affected
  the character of the evolving culture.”<a href="#_edn16"
name="_ednref16" title=""><span> [16] </span></a></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>Nor was the college itself simply a rural preparatory
  school.  From the very beginning, because of the conditions which produced it
  and because of the quality and the efforts of the men surrounding it, Princeton
  aroused interest and enthusiasm not only in the North American colonies but
  also in Britain.</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>It is against this general background that one must
  place Samuel Davies’ preface to the Catalogue of 1760.  Another document of
  the same period, <i>An Account of the College of New Jersey</i>, a pamphlet
  which appeared four years after the library catalogue, makes it clear that the
  surprising liberality and modernity of Davies’ concept of education was not
  an isolated personal view but was a matter of institutional policy.  The name
  of the author does not appear, probably to emphasize that this was an institutional
  statement, as the title page indicates, “published, by order of the Trustees,
  for the information of the public; particularly of the friends and benefactors
  of the institution, in Europe and America.”  The author was Samuel Blair, a
  graduate of the Class of 1760 and a tutor in the college from 1761 to 1764.
  A genuine interest in the techniques of teaching is obvious: </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>The usual method of instruction in the sciences is
  this. The pupils frequently and deliberately read over such a portion of the
  author they are studying, or a particular science, as it is judged they can
  be able thoroughly to impress upon their memories. When they attend their recitations,
  the tutor proposes questions on every particular they have been reading. After
  they have given, in their turns, such answers as shew their general acquaintance
  with the subject, he explains it more at large; allows them to propose any difficulties;
  and takes pains to discover whether his explications be fully comprehended.
  <i>Advantages, which are seldom attainable,  in the usual method of teaching
  by lecture.<a href="#_edn17"
name="_ednref17" title=""><span> [17] </span></a> </i></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>I have emphasized the last clause because it seems
  to me to underscore the concern of the college with genuine teaching, with the
  understanding of principles rather than the mere memorization of facts, with
  the development of the capacity for independent thought.<a
href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span> [18] </span></a> </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>Then follows this remarkable and admirable statement:
  &quot;In the instruction of youth, care is taken to cherish a spirit of liberty
  and free enquiry; and not only to permit, but even encourage their right of
  private judgment, without presuming to dictate with an air of infallibility,
  or demanding an implicit assent to the decisions of the preceptor.&quot;  This
  absence of dogmatism and encouragement of independent thinking leads straight
  to the library, and, echoing Davies, Blair makes the role of the library explicit:
  &quot;The <i>Senior, Junior, </i>and (towards the conclusion of this year) the
  <i>Sophomore </i>classes are allowed the free use of the college library that
  they may make excursions beyond the limits of their stated studies into the
  unbounded and variegated fields of knowledge; and, especially, to assist them
  in preparing their disputations, and other compositions.&quot;<a
href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span> [19] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The ground was already
  prepared at Princeton by the time Davies arrived to lay out so clearly his view
  of the library and education. A college tradition, I suppose, is something that
  makes it different from other colleges down through the years. If an institution
  only five years old can be said to have a tradition, Princeton already had by
  1752 the tradition of teaching that has persisted in varying forms for more
  than two centuries. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Aaron Burr, in addition to all his other admirable
  qualities, must have been a great teacher, hailed by his contemporaries for
  &quot;his easy, familiar methods of instruction.&quot;<a href="#_edn20"
name="_ednref20" title=""><span> [20] </span></a>  By 1752 his methods had become
  the methods of the institution, and when the Trustees published a promotional
  pamphlet in that year in anticipation of the Davies-Tennent trip, they were
  inclined to boast that Prince- ton's undergraduate education was just a little
  better than that offered elsewhere: </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>It may be said, without any intention of disparagement
  to other learned seminaries, that the governors of this college have endeavored
  to improve upon the commonly received plans of education. They proceed not so
  much in the method of a dogmatic institution, by prolix discourses on the different
  branches of the sciences, by burdening the memory and in- fusing heavy and disagreeable
  tasks; as in the Socratic way of free dialogue between teacher and pupil, or
  between the students themselves, under the inspection of their tutors. In this
  manner, the attention is engaged, the mind entertained, and the scholar animated
  in the pursuit of knowledge.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span>
  [21] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The preceptorial system
  was not invented out of whole cloth by Woodrow Wilson in 1905. It had its roots
  in the college even before Nassau Hall was built. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While the strikingly liberal
  views on education and the library expressed in the Catalogue of 1760 were clearly
  a formulation of a general educational philosophy that already existed in the
  college -- continuity being provided by the Trustees and a closely-knit body
  of graduates -- in accounting for these views one needs to look closely at their
  author, Samuel Davies, his background and his experience. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Samuel Davies, born in 1723 in a Welsh farming community
  in New Castle County, Delaware, attended the elder Samuel Blair's school at
  Fagg's Manor in Chester County, Pennsylvania. This school was set<i> </i>up
  on the model of the elder William Tennent's famous Log College. The speculation
  cannot be resisted that something in the teaching of Samuel Blair, Sr. prepared
  the seedbed for the growth of the educational theories expressed by Samuel Davies
  in 1760 and by Samuel Blair, Jr. in 1764.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span>
  [22] </span></a>  The elder Blair had been born in Ulster, had come to America
  in early youth, and had been educated at the Log College under William Tennent.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23"
title=""><span> [23] </span></a>  Something in that fertile soil seems to have
  encouraged the growth of imaginative educational ideas. </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>Particularly relevant to our inquiry are the eleven
  years that Samuel Davies spent ministering to the Presbyterians and other nonconformists
  in Hanover County, Virginia, interrupted only by his trip to Britain for Princeton.
  In Virginia he rode to congregations in as many as seven separate meeting houses
  scattered through I five counties.<a href="#_edn24"
name="_ednref24" title=""><span> [24] </span></a>  In this rather unpromising
  locale extending from the edge of Tidewater west to the effective frontier he
  &quot;established Presbyterianism so firmly…that by the late 1750s he had probably
  become the most celebrated of American Presbyterians,&quot;<a
href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span> [25] </span></a> and at the same
  time he was judged by qualified contemporaries the finest pulpit orator of his
  generation. The young Patrick Henry is said to have attended his sermons and
  analyzed his oratorical style.<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span>
  [26] </span></a>  </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His most important achievement
  in Virginia, however, was his continuing and largely successful battle against
  the established church to win the legal right to preach the gospel, maintaining
  that his sort of preaching was legal under the Act of Toleration of 1689. A
  student of these political activities concludes, &quot;His grappling with the
  legal restraints set a precedent and tone in Virginia that had broad implications.
  Davies was recognized as </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>the liberal, the radical of his time, and his followers
  were the same for their era of revolution and separation of church and state.&quot;<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span>
  [27] </span></a>  Davies argued only for toleration, but his efforts must have
  had some effect in softening up the establishment and thus indirectly helped
  pave the way for Jefferson's religious freedom bill in 1786.<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span>
  [28] </span></a> </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Davies was a political
  radical only in the context of his time and place. Indeed one of the reasons
  he is said to have won the good will of the royal governor was the great success
  of his recruiting sermons in bringing out volunteers to defend the frontier
  against the Indians in the French and Indian War. Yet the experience of marshalling
  arguments against a rigid orthodoxy, of defending firmly over a period of years
  the right to be different, must have given his mind a certain temper by the
  time he sat down in 1760 to write a few sentences about liberal education and
  books and libraries. </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>There is plenty of evidence in his letters and journals of
  his deep interest in books and reading and in education. The strong Presbyterian
  commitment to an educated and even a learned ministry extended in some degree
  to the education of congregations. Jonathan Edwards had urged, &quot;Consider
  yourselves as scholars or disciples.&quot; Douglas Sloan observes: &quot;Probably
  none exerted themselves as vigorously as did Davies in Virginia to assist his
  congregation in carrying out this commission. Davies did not establish an academy,
  probably because his many other responsibilities prevented it, but he encouraged
  several who did, and he constantly tried to supply the people in his churches
  with books and reading material. He wrote often to his friends in London and
  Scotland requesting donations of books for the poor whites and slaves in his
  congregations, and he tried to see that the little reading material that was
  available was passed around from church to church.&quot;<a
href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title=""><span> [29] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>His curiosity extended beyond books to life, and
  he becomes for us the more human because of it. In the diary of his British
  journey he wrote, &quot;When I came to N. Castle in the Evening, I found a Comedy
  called the Careless Husband was to be acted: and as I apprehended I should not
  be known, and consequently m could give no Offence, I went to gratify my Curiosity.
  But the Entertainment was short of my Expectation.&quot;<a href="#_edn30"
name="_ednref30" title=""><span> [30] </span></a>  It is perhaps just as well
  that the representative of Princeton and the American Presbyterian ministry
  was not seen in attendance at Colley Cibber's somewhat racy comedy, but no preacher
  lacking in a sense of humor could have written the final sentence of this entry.
</p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>Davies himself was the author of sermons and hymns
  that went through many editions; his poems were widely read and were the subject
  of a continuing critical debate in the columns of the <i>Virginia Gazette </i>in
  the colony's capital. Only such interests could have made him accept the invitation
  of the Trustees of Princeton to take a leave of absence from his Hanover congregations
  and his beloved wife to go with Gilbert Tennent on an extended trip to England
  and Scotland, 1753-55, to solicit gifts of money and books for the struggling
  college. And only the same concerns could have made him leave Hanover permanently
  in 1759 to become President of the college after declining the election the
  year before, &quot;even though he was assuming the foremost position his church
  could convey.&quot;<a

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As President, in the brief
  period before his early death, &quot;he surprised even himself by the zeal with
  which he proceeded to reform and modernize everything, so that ultra conservatives
  began to sigh for the good old days of unwatered Calvinism. They took </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>fright in his unfeigned joy in promoting secular
  studies and filling the library shelves with volumes on mathematics and Newton's
  philosophy.&quot;<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span> [32] </span></a>
</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>In seeking an institutional model for the sort of
  educational theory that both Davies and Blair were expressing with such clarity
  and enthusiasm, one notes the substantial impact upon the college of John Witherspoon's
  arrival in 1768 from the Scottish universities. But the kind of educational
  enterprise Princeton was to be had already been determined before the advent
  of Witherspoon. As to the English universities, an English historian of education
  has summarized the situation: &quot;Yet when all is said and every allowance
  made, it must be admitted, on the evidence of some of the most gifted of their
  students and the verdict of impartial historians, that the English universities
  during the eighteenth century were generally in a state of repose, not to say
  coma, undisturbed by the fresh vigorous thinking of men conscious of the problems
  with which they were faced in religion and politics, industry and commerce.&quot;<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33"
title=""><span> [33] </span></a> </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>It was fortunate, therefore, that the natural affinities
  of most of those who were establishing new colleges in the North American colonies
  lay elsewhere. The Conformity legislation of 1662 and later years had effectively
  driven dissenting dons out of Oxford and Cambridge. To meet the need for higher
  education conducted free of the restrictions of the Test Act, the &quot;Dissenting
  Academies&quot; began to appear toward the end of the seventeenth century. Often
  supported by wealthy dissenters in the rising merchant class, many of these
  unofficial institutions flourished until near the end of the eighteenth century.
  These academies, although nearly always small, were not preparatory schools,
  but educational institutions of university grade, with formal curricula extending
  for four or five years. The period during which they flourished was a critical
  one in the founding of American educational institutions and in the establishment
  of democratic traditions in the New World. As Bernard Bailyn has summarized
  the situation, &quot;Only the academies broke free [from inertia and traditionalism],
  and though they too carried over traditional elements, they were uniquely progressive
  institutions. In them an impetus, built up within the confines of nonconformist
  intellectual life, and bearing…peculiar proclivities for the new science, was
  released with great innovating force. This impulse carried over into the colonies
  where dissent was endemic, where intellectual restraints were negligible, and
  where the response to motions in English intellectual life were continuous,
  quick, and sensitive.&quot;<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34"
title=""><span> [34] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>For somewhat similar reasons there had grown up in
  Ulster institutions bearing some resemblance to the Dissenting Academies in
  England. The Scotch Presbyterians in northern Ireland were forbidden to attend
  the university in Dublin and the journey back to the universities in Scotland
  was difficult and expensive. Thus &quot;Presbyterian academies&quot; began to
  appear, and the pattern was brought to America in the wave of Scotch-Irish migration.
  Douglas Sloan discusses these academies and their relation to Princeton: &quot;The
  first Presbyterian academies were founded by men who had come directly from
  Ulster or Scotland, but after mid-century most of the academies were established
  by graduates of the College of New Jersey and the pattern was repeated as these
  academies in turn sent out their students.&quot;<a
href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title=""><span> [35] </span></a>  From the founding
  of the Log College in 1747 down to 1802 at least sixty-five academies have been
  identified. Although some of them trained young men for the ministry, many were
  grammar schools only. They do not seem to have been studied enough to permit
  generalizations here about the influence of their educational theories and practices
  upon Samuel Davies, David Blair, and their associates, although it is perfectly
  clear that the general influence of the remarkable Log College group was a pervading
  one in the early years of Princeton. </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>It is to the Dissenting Academies, then, that we
  must look for many of the sources of institutional and educational policy underlying
  Samuel Davies's remarkable preface to the Catalogue of 1760 and David Blair's
  elaboration in 1764 of an educational procedure which gave such importance to
  books and the college library.<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title=""><span>
  [36] </span></a>  The influence was not, of course, a matter of slavish imitation,
  but the growth of similar ideas, nourished by correspondence, by the American
  environment, and sometimes by personal experience such as that of Davies himself.
  The channels through which the influences flowed are relatively clear . </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The influence of Aaron
  Burr, President of Princeton from 1748 to 1757, was probably the most important
  of any of the five presidents before John Witherspoon, if only because he survived
  long enough to have a sustained impact. Burr corresponded on educational as
  well as political matters with Philip Doddridge, who was head of the influential
  academy at Northampton. Their correspondence is the easy and allusive discourse
  of two able men with similar backgrounds and values, engaged in a demanding
  occupation and sharing professional ideas and gossip. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Burr's letter of May 31, 1750, for example, begins
  with an expression of pleasure in Doddridge's books and gratification that these
  books are spreading in Germany. Burr thanks his English correspondent for his
  friendship for &quot;our infant college.&quot; There is gossip about the envy
  of &quot;some among our Episcopal Brethren&quot; and the fact that &quot;others
  of our own Denomination are jealous of the spread of Calvinism &amp; what has
  been here branded with the odious name of New Light.&quot; He tells the story
  of a student Latin oration of such quality that it immediately convinced a critic
  of the College of New Jersey. Then there is talk about a Professor of Oriental
  Languages whom the college needs but cannot afford and reference to a possible
  candidate recommended by Doddridge. Burr expresses his pleasure in &quot;the
  flourishing state of your academy,&quot; comments on his own current reading,
  asks what Doddridge thinks of Grove's <i>Moral Philosophy </i>as a student text.
  He is gratified with the report of his English friend's interview with the Archbishop
  of Canterbury. &quot;The Disquisition, etc. was a very acceptable present to
  our Library.&quot;<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title=""><span> [37] </span></a>
  In<b> </b>this sort of atmosphere the flow of ideas across the Atlantic was
  easy. </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There was even more direct
  contact. Although the diary which Samuel Davies kept on his British trip of
  1753-55 records his introspective musings on his own unworthiness and the varying
  inspirations for his sermons more than his discussions of educational theory,
  it is clear that he talked with the leaders in the academies. While he may have
  been a bit shocked at times, the experience of meeting a large number of prominent
  nonconformists with widely differing views certainly is a part of the background
  of this statement from the preface: &quot;It [the availability of books] will
  teach them Modesty and Self-diffidence, when they perceive the free and different
  Sentiments of Men equally great and good…&quot; The trip was a part of Davies's
  education in tolerance. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Fryd. July 19. Rode to Hull, in Company with a friendly
  Gent. Mr. Ellis, Minister of Cave, one of Dr. Doddridge's Pupils, who like many
  others of them has embibed the modern sentiments in Divinity. The very word
  Orthodox is a Subject of Ridicule with many here. The Dissenting Ministers here
  take greater Liberties than I should chuse. They make no Scruple of gaming,
  attending on Horse-Races, mingling in promiscuous Companies on the Bowling-Green,
  etc.<a href="#_edn38"
name="_ednref38" title=""><span> [38] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>The influence of the Dissenting Academies is specifically
  visible, it seems to me, in two broad areas, teaching methods and curriculum.
  The former is of more interest in the consideration of the role of the library
  in the educational process. The library collection must always reflect to some
  degree the subjects studied, but there is room for wide differences in the extent
  to which the teaching process demands that the library be used or, at the other
  extreme, simply ignored.  A contemporary participant's description of the teaching
  method and the overall atmosphere of intellectual freedom at Northampton Academy
  in 1752, the year after Doddridge's death, parallels closely what we have seen
  Davies and Blair saying about Princeton eight to twelve years later: </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>In<b> </b>my time the academy was peculiarly favourable
  to the serious pursuit of truth, as the students were about equally divided
  upon every question of much importance, such as Liberty and Necessity, the sleep
  of the soul and all the articles of theological orthodoxy and heresy; in consequence
  of which all these topics were the subject of continual discussion. Our tutors
  also were of different opinions…Our lectures had often the air of friendly conversations
  on the subjects to which they related. We were permitted to ask whatever questions
  and to make whatever remarks we pleased, and we did it with the greatest, but
  without any offensive, freedom. The general plan of our studies…was exceedingly
  favourable to free inquiry, as we were referred to authors on both sides of
  every question, and even required to give an account of them…The public library
  contained all the books to which we were referred.<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title=""><span>
  [39] </span></a> </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This is the testimony of
  Joseph Priestley, who was the product of one of the Dissenting Academies, Northampton,
  and tutor at two others. This laudatory account by the famous scientist may
  be slightly suspect as the glowing recollection of a youthful period by a man
  whose pursuit of truth had since led him considerably beyond any nonconformist
  orthodoxy in theology or in politics. Yet one can also speculate that a radical,
  having gone so far, might have remembered his old school as stifling. Shelley
  in retrospect would hardly have found the Oxford of 1811 favorable to the serious
  pursuit of truth, as Priestley found Northampton. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>The linking of the library with these assigned books
  &quot;on both sides of every question&quot; (in complete conformity to the American
  Library Association's Library Bill of Rights) underscores the relation of these
  pedagogical methods to our contemporary concept of &quot;teaching with books.&quot;
  That great man, Philip Doddridge, took another step into the mid-twentieth century
  by giving occasional lectures on the library at Northampton, an early example
  of &quot;library instruction.&quot;<a href="#_edn40"
name="_ednref40" title=""><span> [40] </span></a> Doddridge's method, which he
  emphasized so strongly that he became famous -- or infamous -- for it, was described
  by a former pupil, Job Orton: &quot;He never concealed the Difficulties, which
  affected any Question, but referred them to the Writers on both Sides, without
  hiding any from their Inspection.&quot;<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title=""><span>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One wonders how fully this
  high standard of rationality and academic freedom prevailed in real life, but
  it was certainly given more than lip service. </span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>It<b> </b>is my impression that this enthusiastic
  insistence that students make up their own minds declined a bit at Princeton
  with the arrival of John Witherspoon. He approved of the method in principle,
  but having used it himself to arrive at the Truth, his forceful personality
  may have made it difficult for his students not to unquestioningly accept that
  Truth. In<b> </b>his course on moral philosophy he refers students to a variety
  of authors as diverse as Shaftesbury, Mandeville, Wollaston, Hume, and even
  &quot;the whole Deistical Writers, &amp; the answers written to each of them
  in particular.&quot;<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title=""><span> [43]
  </span></a> In<b> </b>his treatment of them the Doctor may not have been quite
  so evenhanded as Doddridge is said to have been, however . His summary of Hume's
  position makes no attempt to conceal the fact that Witherspoon, as usual, held
  a firm position: &quot;David Hume has a scheme of morals that is peculiar to
  himself, he makes everything that is agreeable, &amp; useful, virtuous &amp;
  vice versa. By which he entirely annihilates the difference between natural
  and moral qualities, making Health, Strength, Cleanliness, as real Virtues as
  Integrity &amp; Truth.&quot; </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>There was almost certainly more lecturing than Priestley's
  &quot;air of friendly conversations&quot; in Witherspoon's classroom. Furthermore,
  as president of the college he was unwilling to tolerate the teaching by others
  of philosophical systems to which he was totally opposed. At least Ashbel Green
  records one such instance: &quot;The Berkeleyan system of Metaphysics was in
  repute in the college when he entered on his office. The tutors were zealous
  believers in it, and waited on the President, with some expectation of either
  confounding him, or making him a proselite. They had mistaken their man. He
  first reasoned against the System, and then ridiculed it, till he drove it out
  of the college.&quot;<a href="#_edn44"
name="_ednref44" title=""><span> [44] </span></a> The principal tutor involved
  was Joseph Periam of the Class of 1762. He resigned at the end of the year,
  but since he took with him a testimonial from the Trustees, it is not clear
  whether or not he was discharged for his injudicious advocacy of the ideas of
  Bishop Berkeley. </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nevertheless, much of the
  liberalism of the Enlightenment was reflected in Princeton's educational theories
  and in Witherspoon's approach to education. At the least he wanted his students
  to be exposed to books in which differing points of view were offered. His lecture
  notes are heavy with bibliographic references. Students were clearly expected
  to read widely, and it is easy to see why President Witherspoon was willing
  to work so hard to build up the college library. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>It is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that the
  methods of instruction developed and in use at the Dissenting Academies and
  adopted at Princeton and other American colleges placed heavy emphasis upon
  the use of books and libraries.<a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title=""><span>
  [45] </span></a> By a twist of history not unique in library annals, the Academies,
  where the teaching methods demanded books, had weak libraries because of their
  small size and their relatively brief history, while the somnolent old colleges
  of Oxford and Cambridge had rich collections. It was clearly the central place
  of the library in the teaching process that made the Princeton presidents and
  trustees give such a high priority to developing the library. </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The other great influence
  of the Dissenting Academies on Princeton and other American colleges was upon
  their curricula. There is a rather surprising amount of detailed evidence on
  what was taught in the colonial colleges and even what textbooks were used,
  in published catalogues and promotional essays, in the minutes of faculties
  and trustees, in student letters and diaries. There is also a surprising amount
  of difference in the interpretation of this evidence. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An early student of educational
  history, Louis Franklin Snow, concluded that: </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>The scheme at Princeton in 1764 [as outlined by Blair]
  has little to offer as a means of culture and of training for the general student
  that has not already been included in the Laws and Orders of Harvard as prepared
  by President Dunster in 1642. The Cambridge curriculum is having its perfect
  work. Pure and unmixed it was received. In this manner it was transmitted. It
  was only the disruption of the Revolutionary War and the readjustment necessarily
  following, which led to its decadence and replacement, in these colleges, by
  something more comprehensive and better fitted to train for citizenship, a purpose
  wholly different from the ideal that governed colonial Princeton, Harvard, and
  Yale.<a
href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title=""><span> [46] </span></a></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even leaving aside the
  fact that the pre-Revolutionary Princeton graduate did in fact have a remarkable
  record of &quot;citizenship,&quot; this summary is hard to square with the evidence.
  A later student has come to quite different conclusions. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>From the Log College, Yale, and Harvard, it [Princeton
  ] drew its emphasis on the classics, and from the dissenting academies in England
  as well as from its parent institutions in this country, the lively interest
  in science which was characteristic of the century….. Princeton became not the
  college of a single synod or a single religion, or a single colony, but a more
  broadly conceived institution which served the purpose of secular education
  as well as the standards and the gradual secularization of purpose…. The application
  to politics of the eighteenth-century faith in reason and in the methodology
  of science led to an American justification for rebellion, for fealty to such
  principles as the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were
  thought to have the same empirical validity as the acceptance of Newtonian mathematics.
  The emphasis on science under the first five presidents had prepared the Princeton
  soil for this approach to politics, but it did not flower until Witherspoon
  brought the immediate impulse from Scotland.<a
href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title=""><span> [47] </span></a> </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This argument may claim
  too much, but it does emphasize correctly, I think, the importance given to
  science at eighteenth-century Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>In<b> </b>making his appeal for benefactors to remedy
  the deficiencies revealed in the Catalogue of 1760, Samuel Davies emphasized
  the greatest need: &quot;…few modern authors, who have unquestionably some Advantages
  above the immortal Ancients, adorn the Shelves. This Defect is most sensibly
  felt in the Study of Mathematics, and the Newtonian Philosophy, in which the
  Students have but very imperfect Helps, either from Books or Instruments.&quot;<a
href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title=""><span> [48] </span></a> Samuel Blair
  four years later was repeating the need for modern books: &quot;The library
  wants many of the most approved modern writers, as hath been already hinted.&quot;<a href="#_edn49"
name="_ednref49" title=""><span> [49] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>These pleas for modern books and particularly for
  scientific books mirror the principal innovations in curriculum of the Dissenting
  Academies. One aspect of the curriculum of the Academies which was clearly echoed
  in America was the strong emphasis upon natural science. For some tutors, science
  was one more avenue of revelation, another way of understanding God's great
  purpose; others, such as Priestley, emphasized the utilitarian aspects of science.
  Natural philosophy was usually taught experimentally, or at least by demonstration,
  thus requiring &quot;philosophical apparatus.&quot; Hence we find Davies in
  the same sentence lamenting the lack of books and the lack of instruments, and
  the various appeals for assistance almost invariably link the two. In the <i>General
  Account </i>of 1754, for example, the Trustees list among the needs: &quot;furnishing
  the Library; which is at present very small; and procuring a proper Apparatus
  for philosophical Experiments.&quot;<a href="#_edn50"
name="_ednref50" title=""><span> [50] </span></a> While the need for books on
  mathematics was emphasized by Davies, the leaders of some of the Academies,
  including Doddridge, believed the subject to have only limited value. </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>Another fixture in the curricula of the Academies
  was of course found in the English universities as well and in the American
  colonial colleges -- the heavy load of courses in Latin and Greek and, for theological
  students, in Hebrew. The Academies took the lead, however, in dropping Latin
  as the medium of instruction.<a href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51"
title=""><span> [51] </span></a> There is some debate about when the practice
  of using English rather than Latin as the language of instruction became general
  - and about the extent to which it was borrowed from the Scottish universities;
  Princeton of course had channels to both the Academies and the Scottish universities.<a
href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title=""><span> [52] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Another innovation of the Academies was the study
  of the English language, primarily composition, with some attention paid to
  examples of English literature as correct models. The emphasis of Protestantism
  upon preaching may have been indirectly responsible for the considerable time
  spent in elocution and oral expression in the vernacular. At Princeton one is
  struck by the importance given to &quot;orations&quot; in English and Latin,
  which survive still today, in form at least, in the two student addresses at
  Commencement, the Latin Salutatory and the English Valedictory. The study of
  the French language was introduced in some of the Academies and at Princeton
  after Witherspoon's arrival (but for an extra fee.) In another emphasis on the
  modern some of the Academies introduced the study of modern history, including
  political theory. Witherspoon's famous lectures on moral philosophy at Princeton
  devoted a great deal of attention to theories of politics.<a
href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53" title=""><span> [53] </span></a> </p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%;
'><span style='font-size:24.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>*</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>It would be of interest to analyze the collections
  of the library in relation to the curriculum, to show that there was (or was
  not) a core collection carefully selected to support specific courses, supplemented
  by additional readings which were (or were not) radical in terms of the prevailing
  philosophy or theology of the faculty. It would be interesting to check the
  collection against the titles sorted into categories by David Lundberg and Henry
  F. May to analyze the relative popularity of the various periods and strands
  of the Enlightenment.<a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title=""><span> [54]
  </span></a> But these studies cannot be made, or rather, if made would give
  fraudulent answers, because of our limited knowledge of what was actually in
  the library at various times in the century, and because of the almost accidental
  way the collection was built. The only eighteenth-century catalog is that of
  1760, compiled only fourteen years after the college opened. Its 789 titles
  in 1281 volumes were nearly all gifts, over a third of them from a single donor,
  Governor Jonathan Belcher. Any librarian knows how nearly impossible it is to
  maintain a policy of accepting as gifts only those books that one would have
  purchased in the same priority! Davies in the preface points out that the &quot;Library

  Gentlemen on both Sides of the Atlantic.&quot;<a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title=""><span>
  [55] </span></a> Then he goes on to reveal the fact that the catalogue was being
  published not so much to show the wealth of the library as to reveal its poverty,
  in the hope of stimulating additional gifts: &quot;But after all this liberal
  Assistance, a Survey of its literary Wealth, which is exposed to View in the
  following Catalogue, will soon convince the Friends of Learning and Nassau-Hall
  how poor it still is in this important article….&quot; The collection thus described,
  almost a random assortment of books within the boundaries set by the beliefs
  and tastes of the donors, can obviously tell us little about the kind of library
  the faculty really wanted. The preface tells us that they were not satisfied
  with the one they had. </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That the Trustees of the
  college instructed a new President to catalogue the library as his first official
  duty and that he responded with an elegant and eloquent tribute to the role
  of the library in the educational enterprise is striking evidence that those
  concerned with the infant college at Princeton believed the library to be important.
  That this evidence and that offered by the Samuel Blair statement merely reflect
  the thinking of the college authorities is amply witnessed by the concern expressed
  repeatedly in Trustee meetings and by the priority given the library in the
  repeated attempts to raise funds.</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
  desperately poor college demonstrated ingenuity, skill, and persistence in conceiving
  and following up a whole range of fund-raising activities: individual solicitation,
  printed and widely distributed appeals, trips abroad, testimonials from well-known
  individuals and organizations, appeals to the government, lotteries, and that
  long-standing ecclesiastical device, the sermon by a visiting minister followed
  by a special offering. In<b> </b>all of these activities, which would do credit
  to a modern professional university development office, the library was prominently
  mentioned at every possible opportunity. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Its place in the financial balance sheet of the college
  was indicated by Samuel Davies in his diary on July 2, 1753, at the beginning
  of the rather speculative trip to Britain to solicit funds for a college whose
  only home was a parsonage: “There is now about 3000£ in the College Fund; but
  this will hardly be sufficient for the Erection of the proper Buildings; and
  if it should all be laid out for that End, there will be Nothing left for the
  Maintenance of the Professors and Tutors, to furnish a College Library, and
  to support pious Youth for the Ministry, who are unable to maintain themselves
  at Learning.&quot;<a
href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title=""><span> [56] </span></a> One can imagine
  the young man, overwhelmed by the responsibility placed in his hands, diffidently
  rehearsing his central appeal on the long voyage over. Buildings, faculty salaries,
  and scholarship funds are still in competition today with library development,
  and that library is fortunate which is not forgotten at the beginning of a capital
  campaign. The library was not forgotten at Princeton in the eighteenth century.
</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Davies and Tennent took with them as a propaganda
  handout, <i>A General Account of the Rise and State of the College…</i>, the
  eight-page pamphlet which the Trustees had prepared in 1752.<a href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title=""><span>
  [57] </span></a> Revised editions of this summary of the aims, methods, and
  needs of the college were published in London and in Edinburgh in 1754, so that
  the canvassers could have something to leave in the hands of those on whom they
  called.<a href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58" title=""><span> [58] </span></a> A
  postscript to the London edition, dated March 5, 1754, said that Davies and
  Tennent expected to be in Scotland from April to August and it named eight gentlemen
  who would receive contributions in their absence. It was an efficient operation.

</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>The new editions made the needs of the library quite
  specific.  A footnote was added at the first mention of the library to insert
  the phrase, “which is at present very small,” and another, following, “the State
  of their Treasury, is altogether inadequate to those I chargeable Demands”:
  “They cannot therefore be accommodated in a Building of less than forty Rooms,
  with a large Hall for public Exercises, a Library-Room, a Dwelling-House for
  the President and other convenient Buildings: the Expense of all which, it is
  thought, will amount to above £2000 Sterling, besides the Charge  of Enlarging
  the Library, and furnishing a Philosophical Apparatus.”<a href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59" title=""><span>
  [59] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>The two emissaries were further armed for their mission
  with an Address to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from the Synod
  of New York, dated October 3, 1753. This Address summarizes the history of the
  college, its importance (with appropriate emphasis for the occasion on the education
  of ministers), and its financial needs: &quot;That after all the contributions
  that have been made to said college, or can be raised in these parts, the fund
  is far from being sufficient for the erection of suitable buildings, supporting
  the president and tutors, furnishing a library, and defraying other expenses.&quot;<a href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60"
title=""><span> [60] </span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Davies
  and Tennent were able to get sixty-eight “approved Ministers of the Gospel in
  or near London” to sign an endorsement of their mission, which they printed
  over the date January 19, 1754. The needs were “for the competent support of
  the President and Tutors, the erection of proper buildings, and furnishing a
  suitable library and philosophical apparatus.”<a href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>61</span></a> The endorsement from the
  Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge has already been mentioned.
  Although he was aiming for bigger things, Davies did not turn down scattered
  books. “He [Dr. Grosvenor] offered me Baxter's or Williams's Works; but I told
  him that I could receive them only for the Use of the College, and in that view
  they would be very acceptable.”<a
href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>62</span></a>
  </span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In spite of his long struggle
  in Virginia against the Established Church, Davies did not hesitate to ask his
  old adversaries for funds -- to his own amazement. After the Bishop of Durham
  had given him £5 he wrote, “It is a matter of pleasing Wonder to me, that notwithstanding
  the present Langour of my Spirits, and my natural Bashfulness I can with Freedom
  and Composure, converse with these great Men.”<a href="#_edn63" name="_ednref63"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>63</span></a> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Without
  detailing all of the fund-raising activities which were so important to the
  college and the library, it is sufficient to say that each president in turn
  seems to have given the development of the library as high a priority as he
  had opportunity. John Witherspoon even before he came to America was deeply
  involved in activities on behalf of the library. The two Princetonians who attempted
  in person to persuade the Scottish minister to accept the appointment were Richard
  Stockton of the Class of 1748, a Trustee and later to be a cosigner with Witherspoon
  of the Declaration of Independence, and young Benjamin Rush of the Class of
  1760, then a medical student at Edinburgh and also to become a signer as well
  as an eminent physician. It seems to have been Rush's enthusiasm and charm that
  in time overcame Mrs. Witherspoon's reluctance to leave home.<a href="#_edn64" name="_ednref64" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>64</span></a> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Witherspoon's
  correspondence with Rush during this period is sprinkled with thoughts of the
  library, even during the days when it seemed as if Mrs. Witherspoon's objections
  would prevail.<a href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>65</span></a> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
  wrote to Rush from Paisley on July 7, 1767, “I have used some Endeavours &amp;
  hope by my self &amp; some others to send a Present of Books to the Library
  by the End of this Season…. I shall be glad to know what [?] is doing for the
  Library in Edin[burgh ].” On October 11 he expressed concern that Mr. Beattie,
  another Princeton Trustee who had stopped by Paisley, “did not seem sensible
  of the Poverty of the College Library which surprised me.”</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
  library was on his mind even in the most difficult days of these negotiations.
  Witherspoon had after much consideration declined the offer of the Trustees,
  who had then appointed Samuel Blair, a 26-year-old classmate of Rush. Blair
  resigned before taking office when the appointment was criticized because of
  his youth; word may also have reached him that Witherspoon was having second
  thoughts and might be available after all. In the midst of this transatlantic
  confusion Witherspoon wrote to Rush on December 21, 1767: “I cannot think of
  going to Edin[burgh] or making any publick Mention of the thing till an Authentic
  account comes from the Trustees -- However you may let our Friends (in Edinburgh)
  know especially I hope who so strongly urged my compliance that I will think
  they use me very ill if they do not exert themselves with uncommon Vigor in
  the Subscriptions for their Library.” It is obvious that Witherspoon would become
  a library-minded college president. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
  December 29, 1767, Rush, who seems to have been confident all along that Witherspoon
  would go to Princeton and whose mind was characteristically running ahead to
  the future of the library, wrote to describe a 2/6 annual library fee at Edinburgh
  University and of the contribution of more than this amount by most students.
  The income of about £100 a year “is all laid out immediately in purchasing new
  Books. W</span><sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>d</span></sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> not a Law of this kind
  tend greatly to enrich the Library of the College of New Jersey? I have many
  other things of like nature to hint to you, but they must be reserved 'til I
  see you.” Witherspoon must have wondered from time to time if all Princeton
  alumni would turn out to be quite so prolific in advice. It has been said, &quot;Rush
  had a talent for making friends, but a genius for making enemies.”<a href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>66</span></a> In the same December 29
  letter Rush goes on to urge the cultivation of a Mr. Randall, who “has it moreover
  in his power to collect a considerable number of Books from the people of Dundee,
  &amp; other towns around him.” Then, of a Mr. Hume: “…his Library I am told
  is very valuable, &amp; contains a number of Books in the Oriental Languages.
  If we can prevail upon him to leave even this itself to the College, the Acquisition
  will be valuable.”</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two letters from Witherspoon
  in January outline additional plans for soliciting aid for the library. This
  concern for funds for the library is reiterated in a number of other letters.
  There is even some rather sharp disagreement between the two new friends about
  the timing and tactics of a major library campaign in Edinburgh. Finally, on
  May 10, 1768, Witherspoon finds time before leaving Greenock to pass along to
  Rush more prospects: “I desire that my compliments be particularly paid to Mr.
  Kinkaid who has a very valuable collection.” In a letter written from New York
  on September 8 he mentions sending the thanks of the Trustees to Mr Kinkaid
  for his donation. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
  could have been predicted from this apprenticeship, President Witherspoon was
  tireless in his fund-raising activities, travelling up and down the seaboard
  with considerable success, planning a trip to Jamaica, and stimulating the Trustees
  to greater activity. One of the Trustees was given so much produce in Georgia
  that a ship had to be chartered to bring it home.<a href="#_edn67"
name="_ednref67" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>67</span></a> In Williamsburg,
  that center of Anglican lethargy, the President preached to a great crowd in
  the Capitol yard and immediately collected £66, to which Governor Botetourt
  was said personally to have added £50.<a href="#_edn68" name="_ednref68" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>68</span></a> Witherspoon seems to have continued his
  efforts on behalf of the library whenever opportunity permitted during the years
  he was in office. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
  is difficult to imagine a more favorable climate to nourish the early years
  of a college library. The college proudly proclaimed an educational policy of
  just the sort which was likely to make the library quite central in the educational
  process. Presidents and Trustees repeatedly enunciated the importance of the
  library in their view of the aims of the institution – “the most ornamental
  and useful Furniture of a College, and the most proper and valuable Fund with
  which it can be endowed.” Of course there was very little money for the library
  or anything else at first, but this problem soon began to be remedied through
  the energetic efforts of the trustees, the presidents, the friends, and soon
  the graduates of the “infant seminary.” </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%;
'><span style='font-size:24.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>*</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span> </span>But what of the physical library during
  these early years, the collections themselves, and the provisions made for their
  housing and use? </p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
  the absence of much specific information, we must assume that under President
  Dickinson in Elizabeth and President Burr while he was in Newark the college
  library consisted of a few shelves of books, perhaps housed in Burr's study
  along with his own personal library. These were both bookish men, who had been
  teaching students independently before the college was chartered, and their
  libraries almost certainly contained several hundred volumes. The inventory
  of Burr's books made after his death lists about 285 volumes.<a href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>69</span></a> Here in the study the books
  could be adequately protected and loaned on cautious terms to the students.
  The study would have been the room, I suspect, in which a considerable amount
  of tutoring went on. These good men, Burr especially, were excellent teachers,
  and when one of them reached up for a volume to elucidate a point, he probably
  did not care whether he was reaching to the college shelves or his own. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
  first reference to the library in the surviving official records is a note in
  the Minutes of the Board of Trustees for September 26, 1750: “Ordered that the
  President be allow'd to apply Certain Donations in his and Mr. Woodruff's hands,
  to procure a book-Case for the Use of the College.” We may beyond doubt construe
  this minute as a sign that the infant library had grown in its three years of
  life and had already acquired a trait which would periodically plague the Trustees
  for two hundred years and more: the habit of quickly outgrowing the space provided
  for it. This particular growth may have been the product of one of the first
  of a fairly steady flow of gifts. The Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian
  Knowledge had expressed its gratification upon learning that the college had
  been chartered by voting to send “a parcel of good books” not to exceed £30
  in cost.<a href="#_edn70" name="_ednref70" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>70</span></a> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
  proceeds from the successful Davies-Tennent expedition must have been applied
  in part to the library, as planned. The Account Book kept by President Burr
  from 1753 to his death in 1757 records surprisingly large expenditures for books.<a
href="#_edn71" name="_ednref71" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>71</span></a>
  For example, an entry of June 10, 1756, indicates that Mr. Buell of Easthampton
  was paid £21 for “books from London,” and there are substantial payments to
  John Ward, a London bookseller.<a href="#_edn72"
name="_ednref72" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>72</span></a> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It<b>
  </b>is not clear, of course, that all of these expenditures were for the library.
  One of the numerous duties of President Burr was to serve as the college bookseller,
  selling textbooks to students. Some of these charges are certainly for textbooks.
  A letter from John Ward to Burr contains an itemized account for the current
  shipment, totalling £32-7-0.<a
href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>73</span></a>
  There are ten copies of Cole's Dictionary, fourteen of Salmon's Grammar, and
  so on, clearly stock for the student bookstore. I suspect that the library account
  and the bookstore account were often hopelessly muddled, for there are also
  single copies of titles that could hardly be textbooks. A summary account is
  attached for the period October 4, 1755-September 27, 1757, totalling the substantial
  sum of £196-9-5. John Ward also acted as an agent for gifts for the library,
  several of which were forwarded with this shipment. </span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The first visitor to the
  library to have left a record, appropriately enough in view of the intellectual
  debt of the young college to Yale, was Ezra Stiles, later to become president
  of that institution. Stiles, eight years out of college and practicing law,
  made a trip on horseback from New Haven to Philadelphia and returned in the
  autumn of 1754, keeping a diary of his journey.<a href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74" title=""><span

  fund-raising trip to England, after a successful lottery, and after the difficult
  decision had been made to permanently locate the college in Princeton, the Trustees
  met on July 22, 1754, and voted to lay the foundation of the principal college
  building immediately, according to a plan drawn by Dr . William Shippen, brother
  of the trustee Robert Shippen, and by Robert Smith, a Philadelphia architect
  and builder. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
  November of 1756 the students, the tutors, and the library moved from Newark
  into the largest academic building in the colonies.<a href="#_edn76" name="_ednref76"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>76</span></a> The library room was at
  the center of the north (the front) side of the building on the second floor,
  with five windows looking out toward Nassau Street. Its position is immediately
  apparent in the often-reproduced engraving by H. Dawkins that accompanied Samuel
  Blair's <i>Account </i>in 1764. In spite of two great fires and substantial
  remodelling, those familiar with the present Nassau Hall can visualize the library
  of 1756 as occupying the upper part of the area now filled by the marble memorial
  hall which one enters from the main door, extending back from the front wall
  to the line of the east-west corridor. Entered almost certainly from the second
  floor corridor, the library room must have been about 35 feet by 20 feet in
  size, reflecting the sanguine hopes of the trustees for the growth of the college
  and the library.<a href="#_edn77" name="_ednref77" title=""><span

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Using
  present-day standards for estimating shelf capacity, I calculate that wall shelving,
  seven shelves high, covering all walls except that with the windows and allowing
  for a fireplace on each of the side walls (chimneys went through these walls),
  would accommodate about 2600 volumes.<a href="#_edn78" name="_ednref78" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>78</span></a> This estimate makes no allowance for the
  scientific instruments, which may have been kept in freestanding cases. Even
  more volumes could have been housed, and perhaps more elegantly, if the shelves
  were arranged not flat against the wall but in bays, as was often the practice
  in larger eighteenth-century libraries. Since the five windows were spaced about
  eight feet on centers, well-lighted bays could have been provided, but the arrangement
  of the remainder of the room might have been a bit awkward. </span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
  Harvard library was using an arrangement of this sort early in the next century,
  presumably installed when the library was moved to the new Harvard Hall following
  the great fire of 1764. Elias Boudinot, a Princeton trustee, describes the Harvard
  library as it was when he visited the same room in 1809: “The Library is large
  &amp; well chosen, consisting of 15000 Volumes, advantageously placed in Alcoves
  which are very convenient. There are 5 alcoves on each side, with a window in
  each alcove, and the name of the Donor over the entrance in large gold Letters.&quot;<a href="#_edn79" name="_ednref79" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>79</span></a> His obvious interest in the alcove arrangement
  may suggest that it was unfamiliar to him, even though he knew the Princeton
  library well from his meetings with the Trustees and with an even more august
  body in that room when he was President of the Continental Congress. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
  is believed that Yale's library in the mid-eighteenth century was arranged on
  shelves flat against the wall. The room on the second floor of the College House
  was occupied in 1718 and must have begun to be crowded by the time of the Yale
  1743 catalogue, when 2600 volumes seem to have been shelved in a room about
  21 feet by 31 feet.<a href="#_edn80" name="_ednref80" title=""><span

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It seems clear that in
  the eighteenth century the college library was not thought of as a place to

  later indicates that the library had 1281 volumes (789 titles) in 1760.<a href="#_edn83"
name="_ednref83" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>83</span></a> 0f these
  volumes some 475 had come from the library's first notable benefactor, Governor
  Jonathan Belcher. The Trustees Minutes for September 24, 1755 take notice of
  the gift, then record a formal Address of Thanks. “The late extraordinary Influence
  of your Generosity, in endowing our public library, with your own excellent
  Collection of Volumes, a Set of Globes, and other valuable Ornaments, can never
  be mentioned by us without the most grateful Emotions.” The address then goes
  on to propose that the new college building be named “Belcher Hall” in his honor.
  The Governor's response is recorded in the Minutes of the meeting of September
  29, 1756: “…I absolutely decline such an Honour.” He then goes on to suggest
  that the building be named “Nassau Hall,” “'as it will express the honour we
  retain, in this remote Part of the Globe, to the immortal memory of the Glorious
  King William the Third who was a Branch of the illustrious House of Nassau.”
  The Trustees promptly accepted the Governor's suggestion. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
  immediate acceptance of the name Nassau with the political and ideological overtones
  given it by Governor Belcher, while it may owe something to the desire to please
  a generous benefactor or even reflect relief that their handsome new building
  did not have to bear the somewhat impolite associations of his name, suggests
  sympathy on the part of the Trustees with the complex of ideas relating to the
  Glorious Revolution of 1688. This Whig radicalism was a part of the texture
  of Princeton and “formed the major part of American Revolutionary theory.”<a
href="#_edn84" name="_ednref84" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>84</span></a>
  </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>The minutes of this same meeting copy the deed of
  gift for the Belcher library and a catalogue of the books. The Governor's library
  contained about what one would expect a cultivated New England Puritan to have,
  with perhaps a somewhat more generours representation of English literature,
  including Milton, Bunyan, Defoe, Dryden, Cowley, Johnson, Watts, Shakespeare,
  Temple, Addison, Pope, Samuel Butler, the <i>Spectator</i> and the <i>Guardian</i>.<a href="#_edn85" name="_ednref85" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>85</span></a>  While in accordance with Governor Belcher’s
  wish no campus bulding bears his name, it is appropriate that the arms at least
  of this first of a long line of library benefactors are carved above the entrance
  of the Harvey S. Firestone Memorial Library and enhance the letterhead of the
  Friends of the Princeton University Library.</p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>At this landmark in the life of the college, the
  first years in Nassau Hall, Princeton had almost 1300 volumes in its library;
  Harvard had more than 5000 at the time of the disastrous fire of 1764, and Yale
  had more than 2600 in 1742.  When that observant visitor of libraries, Ezra
  Stiles, saw the Harvard library at the 1766 commencement, he estimated a total
  of 4350 volumes, thanks to a remarkable outpouring of gifts after the fire.
  By 1783 the Harvard library had doubled.<a
href="#_edn86" name="_ednref86" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>86</span></a>
  That the same rank has been maintained for more than two centuries is not entirely
  a factor of the relative age of the institutions.  The matter is worthy of some
  inquiry later.</p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>After the arrival of President Samuel Davies and
  the publication of his Catalogue of 1760, the next momentous event for the college
  and the library was the coming of President John Witherspoon in 1768.  He brought
  with him not only a new vitality in leadership for the college but also substantial
  contributions of books for the library. One senses his firm hand in the bulletins
  that began to appear in the newspapers.  One such announcement, appearing within
  months of his arrival, invited “young Gentlemen, who have finished the ordinary
  Course of Philosophy, to return and pursue their studies at College, and fit
  themselves for any of the higher Branches to which they shall think proper chiefly
  to devote their future Application, whether those called learned Professions,
  Divinity, Law and Physic, or such liberal Accomplishments in general, as fit
  young Gentlemen for serving their Country in public stations.”<a href="#_edn87" name="_ednref87" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>87</span></a>  Astonishingly it was announced that no
  tuition fees (except for instruction in French) would be charged for this post-baccalaureate
  independent study.  A number of students took advantage of this opportunity,
  one of them, it will be remembered, being James Madison.</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The particular importance
  of the library in this sort of “graduate” work was recognized, and in sharp
  contrast to his predecessors, Witherspoon chose to emphasize not the poverty
  of the library but its quality:</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>The President will also endeavour to assist every Student
  by Conversation, according to the main Object, which he shall chuse for his
  own Studies; and will give Lists and Characters of the principal Writers on
  any Branch, that Students may accomplish themselves, at the least Expense of
  Time and Labour.  For the attainment of their Ends, a very valuable Addition
  to the Public Library was brought over with the President; another large Collection
  of the most standard Books is newly arrived; and a Third is very soon expected
  from London.  So that this College, which had before all the Advantages for
  Study, that a retired healthful Place could possess, is now well furnished with
  a valuable Public Library, which will be improved by continual Additions.</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While Witherspoon brought
  with him the lecture method, the promised “conversations” and guidance of students
  in their use of the library indicate that, at the “graduate” level at least,
  the great tradition of teaching established by Aaron Burr was not dead.<a href="#_edn88"
name="_ednref88" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>88</span></a></span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>The college life of one of these post-baccalaureate
  students is recorded rather sketchily in the <i>Journal</i>, 1783-85, of Gilbert
  Tennent Snowden of the Class of 1783.<a
href="#_edn89" name="_ednref89" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>89</span></a>
  It is clear that in spite of the optimism of the official announcement some
  years before, the library, after the depredations of the Revolutionary period,
  was no longer adequate.  “I brought several valuable setts of books with me,”
  Snowden writes, “the number of which would have been greater had I not known
  that several of the students had different authors the perusal of which I had
  at my option.”</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>The “continual Additions” promised by President Witherspoon
  were particularly notable in the philosophical apparatus, quite properly considered
  a part of the library and generally housed with it in the eighteenth-century
  American colleges.<a href="#_edn90" name="_ednref90"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>90</span></a>  Despite his inferior training
  in mathematics and science, Witherspoon brought with him from Scotland a recognition
  of the importance of science, thus reinforcing the influence of the Dissenting
  Academies at Princeton.<a href="#_edn91"
name="_ednref91" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>91</span></a>  This
  new stimulus was almost certainly responsible for the action taken by the Trustees
  on September 29, 1769:</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>The Board taking into Consideration the great want
  of a Philosophical Apparatus for the use of the Students in this College in
  Nat[ural] Philosophy, of which it has been long destitute.  It was now Resolved
  that Dr. Witherspoon, Mr. Brian, Dr. Shippen, Dr. Redman, Dr. Harris, Mr. Beaty
  &amp; Mr. Caldwell, or any three of them be a Committee to consult &amp; determine
  upn such &amp; so many of the Instruments belonging to an Apparatus as may be
  judged by them to be the most necessary &amp; immediately wanted.  And the said
  Committee are empowered to send their Orders to England for the same as they
  conveniently can; Provided the amount of the Cost exceed not the sum of 250£
  ster[lin]g.<a
href="#_edn92" name="_ednref92" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>92</span></a></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>Thus armed, the new president personally entered
  into negotiations which would at one stroke put Princeton ahead of its academic
  competitors for the most elegant and up-to-date scientific apparatus.  Of the
  sciences which revealed the divine order, astronomy was queen, dealing as it
  did with the stars in their courses, that army of unalterable law.  The best
  available instrument for demonstrating the movement of the planets and their
  satellites was the orrery.  Harvard had been presented one in 1732, made in
  England, and another had been sent over in 1767 when the first was lost in the
  fire of 1764.  President Clap of Yale had himself made a rather crude orrery
  in 1743, the first constructed in America.  Princeton had none.</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>This unfortunate situation was remedied when in 1770
  Witherspoon persuaded David Rittenhouse to sell Princeton the orrery he was
  building, much to the chagrin of Dr. William Smith and his associates at the
  College of Philadelphia, who had to be content with a later version.  Rittenhouse
  was of course the famous clockmaker become scientist, who later succeeded Franklin
  and preceded Jefferson as President of the American Philosophical Society.<a href="#_edn93"
name="_ednref93" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>93</span></a></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'>Installed in the library in Nassau Hall, the Rittenhouse
  Orrery immediately became the show piece of a growing collection of scientific
  apparatus.<a href="#_edn94" name="_ednref94" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>94</span></a>  In the same year that the orrery arrived
  the first appointment was made to the Professorship of Mathematics and Natural
  Philosophy, established in 1769 but at first unfilled for lack of funds.  The
  first incumbent was William Churchill Houston of the Class of 1768 who had been
  a tutor since 1769 and since September 1770, “College librarian and keeper of
  the Philosophical Apparatus.”  It was Professor Houston who acted as host to
  John Adams when he broke his journey to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia
  by stopping off in Princeton at the tavern known as the “Hudibras,” which stood
  just about where the northwest corner of the Firestone Library now stands.
  After a walk to “Morven,” the eat of Richard Stockton, with a Massachusetts
  student to whom he had brought a letter, Adams says he</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>…met Mr. Euston, the Professor of Mathematicks and natural
  Philosophy, who kindly invited Us to his Chamber.  We went.  The Colledge is
  conveniently constructed.  Instead of Entries across the Building, the Entries
  are from End to End, and the Chambers are on each side of the Entries.  There
  are such Entries one above another on every Story. Each Chamber has 3 Windows,
  two studies, with one Window in each, and one Window between the studies to
  enlighten the Chamber.</p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span>            </span>Mr. Euston then shewed us
  the Library.  It is not large, but has some good Books.  He then led us into
  the Apparatus.  Here we saw a most beautifull Machine, an Orrery, or Planetarium,
  constructed by Mr. Writtenhouse of Philadelphia.  It exhibits almost every Motion
  of the astronomical World.  The Motions of the Sun and all the Planetts with
  all their Satellites.  The Eclipses of the Sun and Moon &amp;c.  He shewed us
  another orrery, which exhibits the true Inclination of the orbit of each of
  the Planetts to the Plane of the Ecliptic.  He then shewed Us the electrical
  Apparatus, which is the most compleat and elegant that I have seen.  He charged
  the Bottle and attempted an Experiment, but the state of the Air was not favourable.
  By this Time the Bell rang for Prayers.  We went into the Chappell, the President
  soon came in, and we attended.  The scholars sang as badly as the Presbyterians
  at New York.  After Prayers the President attended us to the Balcony of the
  Colledge, where We have a Prospect of an Horizon of about 80 Miles Diameter.
  We went into the President’s House, and drank a Glass of Wine.  He is as high
  a Son of Liberty, as any Man in America….<a href="#_edn95"
name="_ednref95" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>95</span></a></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Independence and the Revolution,
  which were to have such an immediately disasterous effect on the college and
  the library, had been foreshadowed at Princeton long before this conversation
  of two of the principal actors. At the Commencement in September of 1766 the
  customary orations took on a patriotic flavor, and most of the seniors made
  a point of wearing American-made cloth.<a href="#_edn96" name="_ednref96" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>96</span></a> On July 23, 1770, James Madison wrote
  to his father, “We have no public news but the base conduct of the merchants
  in New York in breaking through their spirited resolutions not to import, a
  distinct account of which I suppose will be in the <i>Virginia Gazette </i>before
  this arrives. Their letter to the merchants in Philadelphia requesting their
  concurrence was lately burnt by the students of this place in the college yard,
  all of them appearing in their black gowns and the bell tolling.&quot;<a href="#_edn97"
name="_ednref97" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>97</span></a> By 1772
  the Trustees, reacting to some public criticism of student political activities,
  found it desirable to require prior clearance of Commencement speeches, the
  first evidence, I believe, that the students were moving faster toward rebellion
  than the Trustees. </span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
  campus continued to react promptly as the news of each stage of mounting tension
  reached Princeton by the coaches driving through Nassau Street on their way
  between New York and Philadelphia. In 1774 there were various &quot;tea party&quot;
  escapades, in which the college steward's stock suffered, as well as the property
  of at least one citizen of the town. While the faculty probably refrained from
  joining in the bonfires, the burnings in effigy, and the more riotous parts
  of these demonstrations, they were evidently sympathetic. Both officers and
  students agreed to abstain from drinking tea. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
  is usual in such matters, the Trustees, not being on the campus and exposed
  daily to the group enthusiasm, did not move quite so fast. Thus, when the faculty
  selected as Salutatory Orator for the 1774 Commencement one Samuel Leake, who
  had been particularly visible in these demonstrations and who had used insulting
  language to one of the Trustees who had interfered, the Trustees rebelled. At
  their April meeting they cancelled the selection of Mr. Leake and instructed
  the President to appoint another Salutatorian. The following day, “Some Inconveniences
  arising from a Law of the Trustees now in Force giving the Tutors Authority
  equal with the President in all matters of Government,” a committee of the Board
  was appointed, perhaps significantly not including the President, “to draw up
  a Rule for the Administration of the internal Government of the College and
  to determine the Powers of the respective Officers….”<a
href="#_edn98" name="_ednref98" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>98</span></a>
  The travail of empire was being reflected in the first notable tensions among
  the various elements in the college. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>President
  Witherspoon, although a relative newcomer, soon moved into prominence in the
  affairs of the colonies. Beginning with membership in the Committee of Correspondence
  of Somerset County in July of 1774, his writings and his participation in the
  heated debates of various Provincial meetings resulted in his election on June
  21, 1776, as one of the New Jersey delegates to the Continental Congress.<a
href="#_edn99" name="_ednref99" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>99</span></a>
  The Trustees, while at first more conservative, emerged as patriots as the months
  went by. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
  wonders whether the library had any role to play in the heady days before the
  Revolution. It of course played its part in an educational system that laid
  the foundation for a spirit of liberty. “It was from the professoriate, the
  curriculum, and the library that many students pieced together the framework
  as well as the substance of the religious, social, economic, and political tenets
  that guided their immediate activities and future careers. Much of the undergraduate
  curriculum proved most relevant for coping with the exigencies of the Revolution.&quot;<a href="#_edn100" name="_ednref100" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>100</span></a> But while the student could go to the
  library to read John Locke, was the library the place where he became aware
  of the great debate that was proceeding in the rich pamphlet literature of the
  period?<a href="#_edn101" name="_ednref101"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>101</span></a> At the 1769 Commencement
  an honorary degree was given to John Dickinson, along with John Hancock and
  the more conservative Joseph Galloway.<a href="#_edn102" name="_ednref102" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>102</span></a> Had the students read Dickinson's recently
  completed <i>Letters from a Pennsylvania Farmer </i>or the earlier pamphlet
  debate between him and Galloway? Had they read the arguments of James Otis,
  of Stephen Hopkins, of Daniel Dulaney, and were they to read before the debate
  ended on July 4 those of Josiah Quincy, or Alexander Hamilton, or Tom Paine?
  If so, one wonders if they found them in the college library? We would like
  to think that President Witherspoon or Professor Houston, both to become members
  of the Continental Congress, would have seen to it that the literature of this
  great debate -- on both sides of the issue – was made available to the students.
  I suspect, however, in the absence of evidence, that the role of the college
  library was not thought of as being quite so contemporary as to include the
  provision of political tracts. </span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'>There were other kinds of libraries on the Princeton
  campus, however, and soon on most campuses. They were the libraries maintained
  by the college literary societies which flourished at  most American colleges
  from the 1760s until their decline about the middle of the next century. A historian
  who has been studying these societies intensively characterizes them: “The student
  literary societies engrossed more of the interests and activities of the students
  than any other aspect of college life. Elaborately organized, self-governing
  youth groups, student literary societies were, in effect, colleges within colleges.
  They enrolled most of the students, constructed -- and taught -- their own curricula,
  granted their own diplomas, selected and bought their own books, operated their
  own libraries, developed and enforced elaborate codes of conduct among their
  members, and set the personal goals and ideological tone for a majority of the
  student body. When their operations £altered, the college collapsed.”<a href="#_edn103" name="_ednref103"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>103</span></a> </p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
  shall have more to say later about the libraries of the two Princeton societies,
  the American Whig and the Cliosophic, both founded in the mid-sixties. The earliest
  record of their library holdings and of the use made of them does not begin
  until 1813, but we can extrapolate backwards from that later period to con-
  clude that it was just possible that the “Halls” acquired for their members
  at least some of the pamphlets preceding Independence and the adoption of the
  Constitution, as well as the classic works which helped provide the intellectual
  core of those events. While the societies at Princeton were strongly &quot;literary&quot;
  in their interests, their concerns were sufficiently political for them to acquire
  an account of the trial of Aaron Burr and Tom Paine's political works and sufficiently
  current to include quite up-to-date literary works of the period. </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
  the meantime the regular college library collections continued to grow, and
  in spite of increasing political tensions gifts from Britain, or at least Scotland,
  were not cut off. In February 1773, six Scottish gentlemen “from personal esteem
  of the Rev</span><sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>d</span></sup><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Dr Witherspoon President
  of the Colledge of New Jersey, &amp; from conviction that the encouragement
  &amp; support of said Colledge is of great importance for promoting the interests
  of religion in North America &amp; for spreading the Gospel among the neighboring
  Heathen Indians,” jointly pledged from one to ten guineas each to be “employed
  in purchasing such books of divinity or books useful for young men training
  up for the ministry, as the library of that Colledge is not provided with.”<a href="#_edn104"
name="_ednref104" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>104</span></a> In June
  of that year the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge
  appropriated an additional £50 &quot;to the College of New Jersey for books.&quot;<a href="#_edn105" name="_ednref105"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>105</span></a> </span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These early Witherspoon
  years seem to have been among other things a period of generally tidying up
  the college procedures. A college ledger was begun in 1769 (and continued with
  large gaps until 1839) which gives an account of the overall finances of the
  college and particularly its investments.<a href="#_edn106" name="_ednref106" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>106</span></a> Unfortunately it does not often record
  specific expenditures or gifts for the library until almost the end of the century.<a href="#_edn107" name="_ednref107"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>107</span></a> The desire to have orderly
  procedures was extended to the library, obviously none too soon. One of John
  Witherspoon's first acts was to have the Trustees appoint on August 18, 1768,
  Hugh Simm as first Librarian of the college. He served less than a year and
  was not immediately replaced. Before long, however, it was discovered, as it
  has been many times since, that even a small library needs attention. The Librarian
  was missed. “Mr. Sym who was hitherto appointed the College Librarian, having
  removed sometime ago from hence, and it being now represented that sufficient
  care is not taken of the books for want of a properly established Librarian
  who may be answerable for all lost or damaged Books,” something had to be done.<a href="#_edn108" name="_ednref108"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>108</span></a> </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At their meeting of September
  28, 1770, the Trustees addressed themselves to the problem by appointing a new
  Librarian and specifying in detail what he was to do: </span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>To remedy this inconvenience the Trustees now thought fit
  to appoint Mr. William Houston to be the College Librarian &amp; keeper of the
  Philosophical Apparatus; who shall immediately cause all the Books to be collected
  together &amp; properly arranged, and provide himself with a proper Book in
  which he shall enter a very exact Catalogue of all the Books belonging to the
  Library, &amp; shall keep exact and punctual Entries in the same of all the
  Books that may be taken out &amp; returned by the students who shall be answerable
  to him for all Books lost or damaged by them respectively. The Librarian shall
  be at liberty to appoint a Deputy under him for whose conduct he shall himself
  be responsible to this Board. He shall never allow the Library to be opened
  for any student to enter in, or any strangers be admitted but in his or his
  Deputy's presence. He shall also by himself or Deputy be oblig'd to give a regular
  Attendance twice in every week for the space of one hour for delivering out
  Books to the students who shall be allowed but one Book at a time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>To make sure that these reforms would be permanent the Trus­tees
  called for the development of a full set of rules and regula­tions and ordered
  that the income from the library fee be paid to the Librarian as compensation
  for the added duties of supervising the library:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>And in order to satisfy the said Librarian for his services
  in keeping the Library and Apparatus it is ordered that the stew­ard do charge
  in the Quarterly Bills eighteen pence pr.  Quarter on every student or resident
  Graduate belonging to</p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>this College, and that
  he pay the same unto the said Librarian or his Order. And the President is desired,
  in conjunction with the Librarian to draw up a set of Rules and regulations
  for the better management of the Library &amp;c. to be laid before the Trustees
  at their next Meeting, but which on publication shall be immediately binding
  on all the students &amp; Residents of the College.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The unusual length of this minute and
  the obvious thought that lay behind the action taken indicate once again the
  high impor­tance given by the President and Trustees to the library and its
  sound management.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The Trustees Minutes, which are not always
  complete, do not show that any set of rules and regulations was brought back
  to the Board at this time. Perhaps since the rules were to be im­mediately binding
  on publication, it was not thought necessary to have them confirmed by the Trustees.
  If the rules were pub­lished, no copy has survived. The earliest published library
  regu­lations seem to be those printed as Chapter X of the 1794 <i>Laws of the
  College of New Jersey</i>, &quot;Of the Library and Librarian.&quot;<a href="#_edn109" name="_ednref109" title=""><span

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The library fee included in the 1770
  instructions of the Trustees was not, as might be supposed, an innovation brought
  over by the new President at the suggestion of his young friend Benjamin Rush,
  for the Board had already established a library fee five years earlier: &quot;It
  is ordered for the future, that every student and grad­uate (the officers of
  the college excepted) who makes use of the publick library shall pay to the
  steward the sum of two shillings and six pence every quarter of a year to be
  expended for the use of the library.&quot;<a href="#_edn110" name="_ednref110" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>110</span></a> Presumably this useful income was to
  be spent for the purchase of books, since there were at that time no library
  salaries to be met. The innovation in 1770 was the use of the fees collected
  to pay the salary of the Librarian. There must have been some difficulty in
  collecting the library fee, for in 1772 the Trus­tees again took up the matter
  and ordered that students pay the fee in advance to the Steward just as other
  college fees were paid and &quot;that the Steward account for the same to M</span><sup><span

<h3>&nbsp; </h3>
<h3>Of the remainder of the 1770 regulations one need note only the provision
  that the library be kept open two hours a week. By 1794 this period had been
  reduced to one hour. These compara­tively generous hours and the provision for
  a deputy Librarian, when only three years before there had been no Librarian
  at all, suggest a certain expansiveness which had come into the Princeton air.</h3>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>In these years immediately before the
  Revolution the college was prospering. In 1770 there had been 81 undergraduates
  en­rolled plus some 25 students in the grammar school. Three years later there
  were more than 100 undergraduates and as many as 80 grammar school students.
  President Witherspoon took a special interest in the school, the profits from
  which were a personal per­quisite, and it had become one of the best in the
  colonies. The col­lege had almost from the beginning been a national institution
  rather than a provincial one, and the President wrote with pride in 1772, &quot;There
  are at this time under my tuition young gentle­men of the first fortune and
  expectation from almost every prov­ince on the continent as well as several
  of the West India islands.&quot;<a href="#_edn112" name="_ednref112" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>112</span></a> The college finances were by 1775 in
  better shape than they had ever been, the assets having doubled since Witherspoon
  arrived. The curriculum had been substantially strengthened, al­though funds
  were still not adequate to establish but one of the professorships which were
  contemplated. The library had grown from the fewer than 1300 volumes of the
  1760 catalogue to more than 2000 volumes.</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>A vignette to symbolize the end of this
  happy period might pic­ture the sturdy back of John Witherspoon as he rode off
  to Philadelphia at the beginning of September 1774 to see for himself what was
  happening at the Continental Congress.<a href="#_edn113" name="_ednref113" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>113</span></a> Characteristically, he had to be in the
  midst of things, even though he was not to take his seat as an elected member
  of the Congress until June 28, 1776. Becoming more and more involved in revolutionary
  politics, he had less and less time to give to his teaching and the affairs
  of the college. The Congress was to come to Princeton soon enough.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The first of the many intrusions upon
  the college and the li­brary was not an ominous but an optimistic one, for it
  marked the beginning of self&#8209;government. On August 27,1776, 13 councilmen
  and 39 assemblymen of New Jersey met in the library room in Nassau Hall as the
  first legislature of the new state.<a href="#_edn114" name="_ednref114" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>114</span></a> College was in session, but one suspects
  that the students by this time were not making much use of the library. A month
  later, at the regular commencement meeting, a few trustees, &quot;seeing no
  probability of a quorum to do business regularly, on account of the difficulty
  of public affairs,&quot; resolved that an urgent effort should be made to hold
  a meeting in Princeton on the third Wednesday in Novem­ber.<a href="#_edn115" name="_ednref115" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>115</span></a> But on November 16, Fort Washington was
  surrendered to General Howe and in the same week General Greene was forced to
  abandon Fort Lee on the west bank of the Hudson. On Novem­ber 26, Newark was
  abandoned by the American forces, and the retreat headed ominously toward Princeton.
  There was to be no November meeting of the Trustees.<a href="#_edn116" name="_ednref116" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>116</span></a> The Minutes of the Sep­tember meeting
  are followed by this note in another hand: &quot;N.B. The incursions of the
  enemy into the state &amp; the depredations by the armies prevented this meeting,
  &amp; indeed all regular business in the College for two or three years.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>On November 29, with Washington retreating
  toward Prince­ton and the British in slow but relentless pursuit, President
  Witherspoon found it prudent to dismiss the students, having indeed waited until
  the last possible moment. Three days later Washington's cold, tired troops appeared
  at the edge of the town. Nassau Hall, along with other suitable buildings in
  the town, was used for several days to quarter troops. Then on December 7 the
  pursuing British troops began to take over the town, occupying Nassau Hall,
  which was used as barracks, hospital, prison, and command post. There they stayed
  until in one of the flank actions of the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777,
  they were driven out by a brisk attack which included a cannonade by Alexander
  Hamilton's battery. Having soundly trounced the enemy at Prince­ton and Trenton,
  it was prudent for Washington to retire toward the hills of Morristown before
  the full strength of Cornwallis's army could be concentrated against him. Thus
  Princeton was held after the battle for only a few hours by the Continental
  forces, then abandoned to the British, who in turn occupied it for a similar
  period, Washington's strategic position at Morristown making Princeton dangerously
  exposed. After the enemy's depar­ture, American troops under General Putnam
  used Nassau Hall as a barracks until the following June, and in October, 1777,
  the building, derelict as it was by then, became a hospital.<a href="#_edn117"
name="_ednref117" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>117</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The Trustees, meeting in Cooper's Ferry,
  New Jersey, in May, 1777, their first meeting since the hasty one of the preceding
  September, were eager to assemble the students and get back to the business
  of education. They requested Dr. Witherspoon &quot;to move the Congress to resolve
  that troops shall not hereafter be quartered in the College.&quot;<a href="#_edn118"
name="_ednref118" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>118</span></a> As late
  as May 1781 they were still protesting the quartering of troops in Nassau Hall,
  &quot;which is still frequently practised.&quot;<a href="#_edn119" name="_ednref119" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>119</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The cost to the college of its place
  in history was high. Nassau Hall was vandalized, and the little library that
  had been so eagerly and laboriously built up simply disintegrated. Benjamin
  Rush, with perhaps some characteristic hyperbole, writing from Prince­ton to
  Richard Henry Lee four days after the British left on January 3, described the
  town as &quot;. . . indeed a deserted village. You would think it had been desolated
  with the plague and an earthquake, as well as with the calamities of war. The
  College and church are heaps of ruin. All the inhabitants have been plundered….&quot;<a
href="#_edn120" name="_ednref120" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>120</span></a>
  And this was before the years of occupation by the friendly but perhaps equally
  destructive American forces.</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The general condition of Nassau Hall
  was described somewhat later byAshbel Green:</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When the present writer
  first became a student of the institution, in May 1782, only two of the four
  stories of Nassau Hall, were at all habitable. These had been imperfectly repaired,
  but the whole building still exhibited both internally and externally the desolating
  effects of the war of which, for a time, it had been a sort of central point.
  The impressions which had been made in the stout walls by a cannonade at the
  battle of Princeton were still visible on the outside, and some balls that had
  entered the windows, had left evidence of their efficacy, not yet effaced, in
  the rendings of the ceilings and partitions of the rooms. The two stories which
  had received no repairs, exhibited nothing but the floors and walls, stripped
  of their plaster, which with an accumulation of other filth, lay undisturbed
  in the place where it had fallen.&quot;<a href="#_edn121" name="_ednref121" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>121</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The books in the library were almost
  all gone. One suspects that they were used by the troops of both armies more
  often for the starting of fires and for pipe spills than for the study of the
  classics and theology. There is a touch of regret in the comment of Ser­geant
  Thomas Sullivan of the British 49th. Regiment of Foot: &quot;Princeton is a
  compact tho' small town, in which is a good Col­lege, built of stone, sufficient
  to hold four hundred students; but our army when we lay there spoiled and plundered
  a good Library that was in it. There was an organ and a nice Chapel in the Col­lege:&quot;<a
href="#_edn122" name="_ednref122" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>122</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>With the wisdom of hindsight, President
  Witherspoon must have reflected that it would have been possible as the armies
  ap­proached to pack up the books and the apparatus and cart them off to some
  secluded barn. Writing from Philadelphia to his son David, then a tutor at Hampden&#8209;Sidney
  in Virginia, on March 17, 177 7, to describe how the family property had fared,
  he says, &quot;I ordered all my books to be put up in boxes &amp; sent to the
  Country lest the enemy should come that way again but at present we are entertaining
  hopes that they will not come this way at all.&quot;<a href="#_edn123"
name="_ednref123" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>123</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The orrery, perhaps because of its fame,
  fared somewhat better than the books. Although damaged, it was not carried off,
  as was most of the remainder of the philosophical apparatus. President Samuel
  Stanhope Smith, who had been a college officer since 1779, wrote later:</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Orrery was very much
  injured during the revolutionary war. . . . The injuries which it received were
  comparatively small, from the British soldiery. A guard was set to protect it:
  and the officers were said to be contemplating its removal to England; this,
  at least, was the general report and opinion. The principal injury was produced
  by our own militia, when the college was appropriated as a barrack for them.
  Many of the wheels were taken off, as handsome curiosities. This, how­ever,
  was no more than to be expected from a number of ignorant men, so imperfectly
  disciplined as, at that time, they were.<a href="#_edn124" name="_ednref124" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>124</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>We have another eyewitness report from
  the Chevalier de Chastellux of the staff of General Rochambeau, who on Novem­ber
  29, 1780, passed through Princeton, eager to see the battle­fields on which
  Washington had won his famous victories. &quot;The object of my curiosity,&quot;
  he writes, &quot;though far removed from let­ters, having brought me to the
  very gate of the college, I dismount­ed to visit for a moment this vast edifice.
  I was almost immedi­ately joined by Mr. Witherspoon, president of the university….&quot;
  The President showed the General about Nassau Hall, speaking a kind of French
  about which his guest noted, &quot;I easily perceived that he had acquired his
  knowledge of the language from reading rather than conversation.&quot; What
  he saw was discouraging. &quot;This useful establishment has fallen into decline
  since the war; there were only forty students when I saw it. A fairly extensive
  collec­tion of books had been gathered; most of these have been scattered. There
  remains a very beautiful astronomical machine,&quot; he writes, but &quot;it
  was then out of order.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>It is a rather interesting and revealing
  scene, not without a certain pathos: on the one hand the forthright but canny
  Scots­man, in his bad French, but &quot;well pleased to display what he knew
  of it,&quot; seizing upon this visitor, obviously noble and pre­sumably wealthy
  and influential, showing him the desolation of Nassau Hall, wondering all the
  time whether he might really be useful to the college; on the other hand, the
  polished Frenchman, excited about Washington's tactics but not really interested
  in the problems of a provincial college and its missing library, yet too courteous
  to break away abruptly. &quot;I confess also that I was rather impatient to
  seek out the traces of General Washington, in a country where every object recalled
  his successes. I passed rapidly therefore from the hands of President Witherspoon
  into those of Colonel Moylan [aide to Washington, assigned to Chastellux as
  a guide for this journey]. They were both upon their own ground; so that while
  one was pulling me by the right arm, telling me, `Here is the philosophy classroom,'
  the other was plucking me by the left, telling me, `This is where one hundred
  and eighty English laid down their arms.' &quot;<a href="#_edn125"

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Funds had to be found somewhere to get
  the college going again, and the prospects were dim in the present unsettled
  state of the former colonies, which had established their independence but which
  had not yet become a country. The Trustees were forced to establish priorities.
  This time the library had to wait until the very fabric of the building could
  be restored and living quar­ters provided for the returning students. The Trustees
  agreed to repair the roof first, then to glaze the windows on the front, then
  to repair the chambers on the second story &quot;but to proceed no further than
  to secure the roof, unless the committee appointed to apply to Congress, succeed
  in obtaining the money for the damages done to the building by the troops.&quot;<a
href="#_edn126" name="_ednref126" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>126</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>These efforts of the committee were successful,
  a total of $19,357 in Continental currency having been received by No­vember
  6, 1779, but this proverbial currency was depreciating so rapidly that by the
  time the money was in hand a dollar was worth only about five cents in cash.<a href="#_edn127"
name="_ednref127" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>127</span></a> Even
  the building repairs had to proceed very slowly. All of the old fund&#8209;raising
  devices were tried, with indifferent success, for most of the friends of the
  college had severe financial problems themselves.<a
href="#_edn128" name="_ednref128" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>128</span></a></span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>About this time the library figured prominently
  in an occurrence which brought excitement to the college and the town at the
  same time that it demonstrated the uncertainty of the times. In June of 1783
  the Continental Congress, threatened in Philadelphia by mutinous soldiers demanding
  their back pay, accepted the sanctu­ary promised by the Governor of New Jersey
  and the hospitality of Colonel George Morgan at &quot;Prospect,&quot; then of
  the College of New Jersey.<a href="#_edn129" name="_ednref129" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>129</span></a> During the summer and fall of 1783 the
  little town took on the bustle of a national capital, and the library, already
  stripped of its books, served as the hall of Congress. The prayer hall was probably
  used for ceremonial occasions, such as the formal expression of thanks to George
  Washington by the Congress or the reception of the first of the envoys to the
  new nation, Peter John Van Berckel, Minister Plenipotentiary from the Netherlands.
  The unused student chambers served as offices and committee rooms.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>After this exciting interlude the arduous
  task of rebuilding had to be continued. In desperation, remembering the success
  of the Tennent&#8209;Davies mission and perhaps stimulated by the presence of
  many foreign visitors, the Trustees authorized an ill&#8209;conceived venture,
  a fund&#8209;raising trip abroad. In December 1783, John Witherspoon and Joseph
  Reed, President of the State of Penn­sylvania and a Princeton trustee, set sail.
  Arriving in London, Dr. Witherspoon sent off around of letters to personal friends
  and people known to have been friends of the college. Because of the occupation
  of Nassau Hall by British and American troops, &quot;the College has suffered
  greater injury than any other Institution of the kind,&quot; he wrote in an
  eloquent appeal drafted for the Earl of Buchan. &quot;The Building was laid
  waste, the Library almost totally destroyed, the apparatus entirely taken away
  &amp; the Orrery much injured though not removed.&quot;<a href="#_edn130"
name="_ednref130" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>130</span></a></span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Had he waited for replies to these letters
  before he left Prince­ton, he would surely not have taken the trip, for they
  were blunt and almost uniformly discouraging. Dr. John Erskine, an old friend,
  quotes the comment of another friend which is typical: &quot;I must doubt whether
  there is such a spirit of reconciliation with America in this country as would
  give any encouragement to his business. Besides I think it a great abasement
  of the Majesty of the United States, to send a late member of Congress a begging
  in England for any purpose whatever…. I am afraid he need be cautious in relating
  the Gothic burning of his library. It might hurt his business and endanger his
  safety.&quot;<a
href="#_edn131" name="_ednref131" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>131</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Witherspoon wrote also to the American
  peace commissioners who were in Paris at the time, asking about his chances
  in France. John Jay's reply indicates that Witherspoon (whose letter is lost)
  had asked specifically about gifts of three kinds: money, books, and scientific
  instruments. &quot;I could not prevail upon myself,&quot; Jay writes, &quot;to
  advise the experiment&quot; of a trip to Paris. He adds wryly, &quot;I am much
  mistaken if Europe in general does not wish that we were less knowing than we
  are already.&quot;<a
href="#_edn132" name="_ednref132" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>132</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>But it was Benjamin Franklin who, in
  his direct fashion, put the matter in a light which must have made Witherspoon
  see that he should go home just as soon as he could discharge his responsi­bility
  to the Trustees. Franklin begins by advising against the venture on the practical
  grounds that the returns would prob­ably be less than the cost. President Wheelock
  of Dartmouth had come to Paris the year before seeking funds and had received
  little help. Then he opposes the trip on diplomatic grounds: &quot;the very
  request would be disgraceful to us and hurt the Credit of Responsi­bility we
  wish to maintain in Europe by representing the United States as too poor to
  provide for the Education of their own Children.”<a href="#_edn133" name="_ednref133" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>133</span></a></span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>These letters may have made even John
  Witherspoon, as shame­less a fund raiser as any Ivy League president of today,
  reflect a bit. Poverty may be a virtue in some parts of the Church, but to emphasize
  it constantly was hardly in accord with the aspirations of the new nation. On
  the outside of the manuscript of the memorial for the Earl of Buchan is written,
  &quot;On further considera­tion I thought it indecent that anything of a mendicant
  shape should appear in Britain.&quot;</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>On the practical side the Doctor's advisors
  turned out to be ac­curate. He reported to the Trustees at their fall meeting,
  and the committee appointed to audit his accounts announced the next day that
  after deducting all expenses they found a balance in favor of the college of
  only five pounds, fourteen shillings. His pupil and admirer Dr. Green concludes
  sadly that &quot;this occurrence must be set down as a defect in that sagacity
  and foresight for which he was generally remarkable.&quot;<a href="#_edn134"
name="_ednref134" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>134</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The library did make some progress during
  these hard years. The Trustees Minutes note occasional gifts of books: on August
  2, 1785, from Dr. John Rodgers, one of their number, &quot;an elegant copy of
  Aiius Montanus's Hebrew bible&quot;; on September 27, 1792, from the Society
  in Philadelphia for the Abolition of Slavery &quot;a number of books &amp; pamphlets
  on subjects coming within the scope of that institution&quot;; on April 10,
  1793, &quot;several valuable donations of books…presented by gentlemen in Britain&quot;;
  on May 6, 1795, a gift of books from &quot;some gentlemen in Scotland.&quot;
  Indeed, on September 28, 1786, whether merely in hope or in recognition of an
  increasing harvest, the Trustees ordered &quot;that the treasurer prepare a
  blank book bound and lettered, in which he shall enter all donations made to
  the library, together with the names of the persons who bestow them.&quot;<a
href="#_edn135" name="_ednref135" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>135</span></a></span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>By 1788 the library had evidently sufficiently
  recovered to re­quire a catalogue. On November 25 of that year, President Wither­spoon
  authorized the Treasurer of the College to pay David Lyall twenty dollars for
  &quot;arranging &amp; making Catalogues of the Books&quot; in the library.<a href="#_edn136"
name="_ednref136" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>136</span></a> Five
  years later another catalogue was needed, either because of the growth of the
  collection or because the Lyall catalogue was inadequate for some other reason.
  At the Trustees meeting of April 10, 1793 it was resolved &quot;that Dr. Witherspoon
  be empowered to procure a complete catalogue of the library to be formed with
  a double index.&quot; These catalogues were apparently never printed, and the
  manuscript copies were un­doubtedly destroyed with the books in the fire of
  1802.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>This was a period in which various college procedures and
  regulations were codified, probably under the tensions growing out of increasing
  student activism. One would like to believe that it was responsiveness to student
  demand that led the Trustees to affirm on September 28, 1786, that &quot;all
  the students shall have access to the library under the regulations on that
  head estab­lished,&quot; a resolution evidently intended to insure that underclass­men
  were to have full use of the library.</p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>In 1794 Princeton's first printed and
  published library regula­tions appeared as Chapter X of <i>Laws of the College
  of New Jersey, Reviewed, Amended, and Finally Adopted, by the Board of Trus­tees
  in April, 1794</i> (Trenton: Isaac Collins, 1794). One thousand copies of this
  36&#8209;page pamphlet were ordered to be printed, and each student was to be
  furnished with a copy upon payment of twenty cents. The library regulations
  lack some of the color which other rules of the college certainly had; for example,
  &quot;No hal­looing, loud talking, whistling, jumping or other boisterous noise,
  shall be permitted in the entries or rooms of the college at any time.… Any
  student who may be required to do so, shall open the door of his room or study
  to any officers of the college; and if he refuse, the officer may break it open,
  and the expense of re­pairing it shall be defrayed by the student, who shall
  also be punished for disobedience…. No student shall be allowed to disguise
  himself by wearing women's apparel….&quot; But the library laws do have some
  interest, if only because of their primacy:</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>There is a great deal of similarity between
  these regulations and those of the other colonial colleges, going back to the
  Har­vard &quot;Rules for the Library Keeper&quot; of 1667. The Yale regula­tions
  were first printed in 1745 as a chapter in the college laws, and William and
  Mary did not publish its library regulations until 1792, along with the college
  statutes. All of these regulations are primarily concerned with the protection
  and preservation of the books and the controls necessary to this end.<a href="#_edn137"
name="_ednref137" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>137</span></a></span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The Harvard rules are much more elaborate
  and were revised more often during the eighteenth century than any of the others.
  One wonders whether this greater attention to library details is one of the
  factors which made the Harvard collections grow more rapidly. It is at Harvard
  that the attributes of a research or refer­ence library first appear in American
  college library statutes. In its 1765 laws provision was made for study tables
  and chairs in the library, which was to be kept open for use from nine to twelve
  and from three to five, one day a week.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The Bodleian Library at Oxford probably
  set the pattern for the English university libraries when its first statutes
  (1610) pro­hibited the lending of any books but required the building to be
  kept open for use on weekdays from eight to eleven and two to five (one to four
  in winter) at the special insistence of Sir Thomas Bodley.<a href="#_edn138" name="_ednref138" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>138</span></a> Bodley felt that the lending of books,
  even to noble patrons, would lead to &quot;the abuse of all good order, &amp;
  totall ruine of the Library.&quot;<a
href="#_edn139" name="_ednref139" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>139</span></a>
  This view of library management was passed along indirectly to Harvard in 1725
  when the first Thomas Hollis of London exercised the privilege of major donors
  to criticize the practices of the Harvard College Library, writing &quot;Your
  library is reckoned here to be ill managed, by the account I have of some that
  know it, you want seats to sitt and read and chains to your valuable books like
  our Bodleian library … you let your books be taken at pleasure home to Men's
  houses, and many are lost…”<a href="#_edn140"
name="_ednref140" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>140</span></a> I suspect
  that the practice of lending books for use outside the library began in the
  early American colleges as a matter of expediency, the librarian having too
  many other duties to allow him to sit in the library all day. The circulating
  library became the American norm, of course, although there are notable research
  library exceptions.</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>A comparison of the published regulations
  of the American colleges seems to indicate that only at Princeton could all
  under­graduates borrow books from the library without any special per­mission.
  If this is indeed true, the Princeton library was already beginning to reflect
  that special emphasis on undergraduate edu­cation which had been forecast by
  Samuel Davies in 1760 and which was to characterize Princeton for another century
  and more. The failure to develop professional schools and genuine graduate studies
  until near the end of the nineteenth century affected the library in many ways,
  rate of growth. being perhaps the most obvious.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>On November 15, 1794, the &quot;Old Doctor,&quot;
  John Witherspoon, died at “Tusculum” at the age of 72. The circumstances that
  made him the only college president to sign the Declaration of Inde­pendence
  added to the fame that his pupils were already spreading through the states.
  But one wonders what the college and its li­brary might have become under his
  determined leadership had not the war intervened. He was succeeded by his son&#8209;in&#8209;law,
  Sam­uel Stanhope Smith, who had already as Vice&#8209;President played an increasing
  part in the operation of the college as the Doctor's health failed.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>President Smith's dream of making the
  college the leading in­stitution of higher education in the country was to founder
  on the more conservative views of the Trustees, driven by the winds of student
  dissent which were sweeping across the country.<a href="#_edn141" name="_ednref141" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>141</span></a> It was evidently his initiative that
  led the Trustees to appoint a com­mittee to seek aid for the college from the
  New Jersey legislature, and an eloquent appeal was drafted, pointing out that
  &quot;For the Library, for the Philosophical apparatus, and for the capital
  sunk by payments necessarily received in a depreciated currency, no reparation
  has ever been made by the State or by the federal gov­ernment.”<a href="#_edn142" name="_ednref142" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>142</span></a> The legislature after a great deal of
  lobbying by the committee and other friends of the college granted £600 per</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>year for three years, “appropriated,
  however, specially by the law, to the repair of the College, the purchasing
  of a philosophical apparatus, and replenishing the Library.”<a href="#_edn143" name="_ednref143" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>143</span></a> It is not clear how much of this money
  the library actually received. At the meeting at which the committee reported
  its success the Trustees immedi­ately resolved that of the first money received
  $1200 be spent for philosophical apparatus. Then $400 was appropriated for building
  repairs. There is no further mention in the Trustees Minutes of any further
  specific distribution of these funds to the library.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>That the library did not at this time
  have as high a priority with the Trustees or the new administration as it formerly
  had is suggested by certain niggling negotiations with Samuel Campbell, a New
  York bookseller.<a
href="#_edn144" name="_ednref144" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>144</span></a>
  President Witherspoon had evidently placed a library subscription for the third
  edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, currently being published. After
  his death, some question must have been raised about the extravagance of this
  purchase, and a Trustee committee was appointed to negotiate with Mr. Campbell.
  He offered to take the set back, but the com­mittee finally agreed to accept
  the 16 volumes already in America</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>and the remaining volumes as they appeared,
  all of which were to be uniformly bound. To have such an incident appear in
  the minutes of four meetings of the Trustees (May 7, 1795; April 13 and September
  28, 1796; and September 26, 1799) hints at a nig­gardliness in library expenditures
  which did not make the future without Witherspoon look very promising.<a href="#_edn145"

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Two travellers who recorded their impressions
  of Princeton about this time have left ample evidence that the college had not
  yet recovered completely from the war. Moreau de Saint Mery, a Martinique&#8209;born
  Frenchman who spent four years in Philadel­phia, found the front yard of the
  college “untidy, covered with the droppings of animals who came there to graze….
  Everything bears the imprint of negligence, and one reaches the building grieved
  that the pupils have such an unpleasant example before their eyes…. Behind the
  college there is an extremely large court yard. It is dirty and uncultivated,
  and everything in it [gives] evidence of neglect.”<a href="#_edn146"
name="_ednref146" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>146</span></a> Inside
  Nassau Hall he noted without com­ment &quot;a chapel, a refectory, a library
  of about two thousand vol­umes, and the justly celebrated planetarium built
  by Dr. David Rittenhouse.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Isaac Weld, a somewhat jaundiced Anglo&#8209;Irish
  tourist, received an equally unfavorable impression:</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>Here is a large college, held much in repute by the neighbor­ing
  states. The number of students amounts to upwards of seventy; from their appearance,
  however, and the course of studies they seem to be engaged in, like all the
  other American colleges I ever saw, it better deserves the title of a grammar
  school than a college. The library, which we were shewn, is most wretched; consisting,
  for the most part, of old theologi­cal books, not even arranged with any regularity.
  An orrery, contrived by Mr. Rittenhouse, whose talents are so much boasted of
  by his countrymen, stands at one end of the apart­ment, but it is quite out
  of repair, as well as a few detached parts of a philosophical apparatus, enclosed
  in the same glass case. At the opposite end of the room, are two small cup­boards,
  which are shewn as the museum. These contain a couple of small stuffed alligators,
  and a few singular fishes, in a miserable state of preservation, the skins of
  them being tat­tered in innumerable places, from their being repeatedly tossed
  about.&quot;<a href="#_edn147" name="_ednref147" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>147</span></a></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Perhaps the poor state of the library,
  at least of its housekeep­ing, can be attributed to the fact that from January
  of 1796 to 1804 neither the Trustees Minutes nor the Faculty Minutes record
  the designation of anyone as Librarian, although the action of the Trustees
  in making such appointments had been meticulously noted more than 25 years before.
  Whether no Librarian was in fact appointed or whether the appointment was not
  considered impor­tant enough to record, some decline in interest in the library
  at the very end of the century seems evident.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%;

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>There is no evidence that anyone had
  borne the title of Librar­ian before the arrival of John Witherspoon. In the
  Minutes of the Trustees, meeting of August 18, 1768, the day following Dr. Witherspoon's
  first meeting with the Board, it is recorded: “Dr. Witherspoon having recommended
  to this Board Mr. Hugh Sim, [sic] a Young Man who came over with him to this
  Country, as a Person of singular Ingenuity &amp; Merit, and well qualified to
  serve the Interests of this College; the Trustees thought proper to ap­point
  the said Mr. Sim to the Offices of Librarian and Inspector of the Rooms in this
  College and Resolved that the sum of five pounds procn: (proclamation) money
  P Annum, together with his Commons in College be allowed the said Mr. Sim for
  his Services in these departments.” </span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>As his obituary was to express it, Simm</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>. . . though bred a mechanic, at an early period of life
  dis­covered so strong an inclination after literary pursuits, that without the
  assistance of a teacher, he made considerable proficiency in the study of the
  Latin language &amp;c. The dis­covery of this invincible propensity to literature,
  as well as the aptness to learn joined to a religious turn of mind, in­duced
  the late celebrated Dr. Witherspoon, when he left Paisley, to take him along
  with him to America, where in Princeton College, New Jersey, over which the
  learned Doc­tor presided, besides devoting his attention to the study of the
  learned languages and other branches of science, he be­came a Student of Divinity.<a href="#_edn148" name="_ednref148"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>148</span></a></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>On December 2, 1768, in his first letter
  home, Simm wrote to his brother, a weaver in Paisley:</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>on my first arrive [<i>sic</i>]
  here I was exammened [<i>sic</i>] and faund [<i>sic</i>] qualifyed in all the
  yousfoul [<i>sic</i>] learning that is taught here and heave [<i>sic</i>] received
  the degree of batcheleer [<i>sic</i>] of arts on which occasion I composed and
  spoke a latine oration before the trustees of the college which was very obligingly
  recived [<i>sic</i>] -- the doctor teaches me divinity privately and have allready
  composed some sermons with which he is very much pleased -- he is very kind
  to me and I have just now received from him six pounds of monny [<i>sic</i>]
  -- I receive my mainence [<i>sic</i>] in the college and heave a room of my
  own&#8209; -- the professors are very obliging to me and I am. at present the
  first student [illegible word] the college….<a href="#_edn149" name="_ednref149"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>149</span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>For a student without a previous degree to be awarded a B.A.
  upon examination almost immediately after his arrival was cer­tainly unusual
  and possibly unprecedented. At almost every com­mencement during this period
  honorary degrees were awarded to distinguished men, beginning with Governor
  Belcher in 1748. The degree <i>ad eundem</i> was also frequently awarded to
  graduates of other colleges upon the completion of certain formalities, an M.A.
  <i>ad eundem</i> being granted at the commencement of 1768 to Alex­ander Sears
  Hill, A.M., of Harvard. But the degree to Simm was clearly regarded as something
  different. The account of the com­mencement exercises of 1768 in the October
  12, 1768, <i>Pennsyl­vania Chronicle</i>, after listing the other recipients
  of degrees, continued, “Hugh Sim [<i>sic</i>], of Scotland, was admitted to
  the honorary degree of Bachelor of Arts.” In the broadside catalogues which
  began to be issued in 1770, listing all graduates by classes, Simm's name is
  separated from the names of the regular degree recipients by a type rule, as
  are honorary and <i>ad eundem</i> degree recipients in other classes.<a href="#_edn150" name="_ednref150"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>150</span></a> There can be no doubt
  that Dr. Witherspoon thought him an exceptional young man.</p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Six months after his December 2 letter,
  Simm begins another letter to his brother:</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>In my former letters I informed you of the steaddiness of
  the Drs favour towards me which in many instances hath been more than I could
  either expect or deserved I shall thairefore say no more with respect to that
  but inform you of another change in my condition which hath lately taken place
  -- After I had taught about six months in the College a letter came to the Doctor
  desiring to know if he could provide a teacher for a grammar school about twenty
  miles from the college (at Freehold, New Jersey) -- The Doctor thought proper
  that I should undertake it which was also my own desire I accord­ingly received
  a recommendation and arriving at this place was very kindly received by the
  trustees of the school -- Here I teach latine Greek and natural philosophy .
  . . . I am to receive about 50 or 55 pounds of this money a year, 15 of which
  I pay for boarding.<a href="#_edn151"
name="_ednref151" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>151</span></a></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Thus after about six months ended the
  Princeton career of the college's first Librarian. This skimpy and sometimes
  ambiguous evidence -- and this is all there is -- suggests that his rank was
  something like that of a present&#8209;day graduate assistant. In the two letters
  to his brother he speaks of teaching, but he unfortunately makes no mention
  of his duties as Librarian or Inspector of the Rooms. The latter post, held
  at various times during this period in combination with other college offices,
  seems to have entailed duties somewhere between those of a proctor and those
  of a dean of students.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The salary of five pounds a year plus
  room and board suggests something like a modest fellowship rather than a teaching
  rank. The new professorship in mathematics and natural philosophy was filled
  in 1771 at £125 per year, with the expressed hope that the salary could be raised
  in the future, and Dr. Witherspoon's initial salary was £350 plus various perquisites.
  The increase to £50&#8209;55 for Simm when he took his grammar school position
  also tells something about the position of college Librarian at Princeton in
  1768. While it is evident that the faculty and the Trustees believed the library
  to be of great importance, it was not perceived that its care and nurture required
  the services at this point of more than a bookish graduate student. The President
  himself, with a handful of professors and tutors, would retain a major interest
  in building the collection and in directing the students' use of it.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>While the influence of Princeton's first
  Librarian could not have been great during a tenure of only six months at the
  age of thirty, the very primacy of his position requires a glimpse at this self&#8209;taught
  man who attracted the attention of the great Dr. Witherspoon. Hugh Simm emerges
  from the letters and docu­ments in the Princeton University Library as an interesting,
  sometimes annoying, and always appealing man.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'>From Freehold, Simm went to a grammar school in New
  York City, where he married, then headed a school in Albany. With the advent
  of the Revolution, in spite of his early association with the rebel Witherspoon,
  he remained a Loyalist and suffered for his opinions. “The unhappy situation
  of the Friends of Government in the midst of the Subversion of Civil and Religious
  order is too difficult for me to describe,” he writes to his brother on October
  2, 1778.<a href="#_edn152" name="_ednref152" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>152</span></a> He had been twice fined for refusing
  to go with the militia to Ticonderoga and “for not going against General Bur­goyne.”
  After his school in Albany was broken up, he went through a period of unemployment
  and real hardship, then was com­missioned quartermaster of a newly&#8209;formed
  British regiment.  Following brief service on Long Island he was retired on
  half pay and at the end of the war was returned first to London and then to
  Paisley, where his pension was continued.</p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>One suspects that Witherspoon discovered
  after six months that Simm's self&#8209;won learning was not sufficiently disciplined
  and told him that there was no future for him at Princeton. Nonethe­less, Simm
  was an intriguing person. With an evident flair for languages, he taught Latin
  and Greek, was ready to teach Hebrew at one point, and in Albany quickly learned
  Dutch. His intellectual curiosity made him a keen observer of nature, and he
  described to his brother with enthusiasm the serpents, the poison ivy, and the
  lightning bugs of the New World. He proposed, five months ahead of the event,
  to test a theory about sun spots through simultaneous observations at precisely
  the same hour in New York and Paisley. When the appointed day arrived, he wrote
  to inform his brother that he was that day to be married, but he had not forgotten
  the proposed solar observation -- unfortunately made impossible by clouds. A
  sincerely religious, but not ostentatiously pious man, he endured substantial
  hardships with a stoic calm. Loyal to his former benefactor Witherspoon after
  he had left Princeton, he stoutly denied some gossip about the Doctor which
  was being circulated in Scotland.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Above all, he clearly possessed that
  essential virtue of the librar­ian, a genuine love of books and reading. As
  his obituary notes, “His fondness for books continued to the latest period of
  his life, by which means he had obtained a large share of historical and general
  knowledge; and being naturally of a social and communi­cative temper he could
  with great facility impart what he knew to others.” In spite of his brief tenure,
  Hugh Simm was surely not an inauspicious occupant of Princeton's first library
  chair.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>After the departure of Simm in the winter
  of 1768&#8209;69 a successor as Librarian was not appointed immediately, and
  the library re­lapsed into disorder. The concern of the President and Trustees
  has been described earlier. This time in filling the post they not only drew
  up a statement of the duties of the Librarian and gen­eral operating principles
  but they also looked somewhat higher in the academic ranks. William Churchill
  Houston had been a tutor for a year when he was made in addition “College Librarian
  and Keeper of the Philosophical Apparatus.”<a href="#_edn153" name="_ednref153" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>153</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>William Churchill Houston had received
  his A.B. from the college with the Class of 1768, and, through the customary
  inde­pendent study and examination, was to receive his M.A. in 1771. When appointed
  Librarian in September, 1770, he had been teaching in the grammar school while
  an undergraduate, had been its master in 1768&#8209;69 (and thus Hugh Simm's
  supervisor), and in September, 1769, had been appointed a tutor in the college.<a href="#_edn154"
name="_ednref154" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>154</span></a> This
  was a responsible post for a young man, since at this time Dr. Witherspoon and
  two tutors seem to have handled all of the college instruction. Houston's great
  ability must have been evident, for in September of 1771, just three years after
  receiving his undergrad­uate degree, he was elected Professor of Mathematics
  and Natural Philosophy, a newly&#8209;created chair.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

  the librarianship until 1783, when he resigned to manage his extensive law practice.

  Houston himself found time to serve for a while as a captain in the Somerset
  County militia in 1776, as deputy secretary of the Continental Congress in 1775
  and 1776, in the New Jersey As­sembly from 1777 to 1779, as a member of the
  Continental Con­gress intermittently from 1779 to 1785, and as clerk of the
  New Jersey Supreme Court from 1781 until his death at the age of 42. This bare
  summary of his service to Princeton and to the nation tells us nothing about
  his role in the library, but it gives some idea of the quality of the man and
  suggests that he probably did as much as anyone could have done to prevent the
  disasters that befell the library during his term of office.</span></p>

  young graduates of the college were clearly able men, most of them with a specific
  interest in education, as their later careers indicate. Snowden became minister

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Robert Finley graduated in the same class
  as Abeel at the age of fifteen and immediately became a master in the Nassau
  Hall gram­mar school. He served similar posts in an academy at Allentown, Pennsylvania,
  and one in Charleston, South Carolina, before as­suming his multiple duties
  at Princeton in the fall of 1793. After studying theology with Dr. Witherspoon
  during this busy period, he became pastor at Basking Ridge, New Jersey, where
  he served until 1817. In that year he became president of the University of
  Georgia but died within a few months of taking office. While at Basking Ridge
  he took leadership in an academy which was to become quite a famous institution.
  He served as a Trustee of Princeton for ten years and as a director of the Princeton
  Theo­logical Seminary for five, and was “the prime mover” in establish­ing the
  American Colonization Society.<a href="#_edn164" name="_ednref164"

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

  “The Sentinel of Liberty.”<a href="#_edn165" name="_ednref165" title=""><span

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>What is one to say about the post of
  Librarian at Princeton in the eighteenth century? Considering the size of the
  collection and the poverty of the college, it does not seem to me surprising
  that the post of Librarian was a part&#8209;time job, but rather remarkable
  that the position existed at all. After Dr. Witherspoon applied his considerable
  administrative talents to the college organization, the Librarian was formally
  designated by the Trustees as one of the handful of college officers. Even though
  responsibility for the library was merely an added duty for a junior faculty
  member, the way in which this responsibility was delegated indicates that the
  Librarian was clearly an academic officer. The library duties were not given
  to the college steward or to the treasurer, for example, but to a teacher, although
  that remarkable man Professor Houston was in the difficult times of the Revolution
  simultaneously li­brarian, treasurer, and teacher. The men who held the post,
  while young, were all men of more than passing ability.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The role of the Librarian can be said
  to share some of the importance of the library itself as articulated by President
  Davies in 1760 and as indicated by the very high priority given to it by the
  Trustees during most of the period. The Librarian was important because books
  were important. Since books were central in the teaching process, it was natural
  to make a teacher the Librarian. Although the duties must have been largely
  housekeeping ones, the consistent quality of the appointments suggests that
  there was never any disposition to give the post to a mere housekeeper. In the
  collegial system of governance which was emerging, the Li­brarian was recognized
  as a participant. He may have been a junior member, not quite equal, but I suspect
  that no one was quite equal to Dr. Witherspoon in a committee meeting.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>There seems to be no reason to think
  that the post of college Librarian was regarded in a substantially different
  light in the other colonies. The Yale Laws of 1745 specify “That the Senior
  Tutor for the Time being shall be Library keeper and Shall Give his Attendance
  in the Library twice a week immediately after Dinner on Such Days as the President
  shall Order….&quot;<a
href="#_edn166" name="_ednref166" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>166</span></a>
  In the William and Mary Statutes of 1727 the Librarian seems to be thrown in
  with a rather mixed bag of college officers; but his appointment, along with
  the others, is dignified by being placed in the hands of the full faculty:</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let the ordinary government
  of the college be in the president and the six masters, viz. the two professors
  of divinity; and the two professors of philosophy, and the master of the grammar
  school, and the master of the Indian school…. To this meeting belongs the election
  and nomination of all officers that are necessary or requisite for the college
  business, such as the usher in the grammar school, the bursar, the li­brary&#8209;keeper,
  the janitor, the cook, the butler, and gardener, the writing&#8209;master, the
  workmen for building or repairing; bailiffs and overseers. But in lesser matters
  the president's order by word of mouth may suffice.<a href="#_edn167"
name="_ednref167" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>167</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>One would like to believe that a Virginia
  tradition of fine food is responsible for the somewhat excessive participatory
  management which requires the cook and the butler to be appointed by the full
  faculty, but there is no comparable tradition of cleanliness to account for
  the similar appointment of the janitor.</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>In Columbia's first set of library regulations
  the library was committed to the care of the Professor of Languages and the
  Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, and one of them was required
  to be present in the library to circulate books one hour each week.<a href="#_edn168"
name="_ednref168" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>168</span></a> These
  titles suggest a somewhat higher level of library responsibility, equivalent
  to that at Princeton under Professor Houston.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The Harvard regulations as revised in
  1765 indicate that the Librarian is to be chosen by the Corporation:</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Librarian shall be
  chosen for a Term not exceeding three years subject nevertheless to be remov'd

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> &amp; on his Removal or
  expiration of his term, he shall give up an account of the state of the Library
  to the Corporation; and the corporation or those whom they shall appoint, shall
  in­spect the library before another choice, &amp; see that the books are all
  in their place &amp; order, &amp; if any damage hath come to the library by
  the neglect of the Librarian, or his inobservance of the laws of the Library,
  it shall be made good, out of his salary or otherwise. And as his trust &amp;
  Work will be increased, by the Regulations &amp; laws now made, He shall be
  allow'd a salary of sixty pounds a year.<a href="#_edn169" name="_ednref169" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>169</span></a></span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>This seems to be a substantial upgrading
  of the position of Librarian, but there are ambiguities. It will be remembered
  that Hugh Simm's annual salary when he was appointed Librarian at Princeton
  three years later was five pounds plus room and board in the college. The discrepancy
  between this and Harvard's sixty pounds might be accounted for if there had
  been any great differ­ence in the academic rank of the incumbents. Simm of course
  had no formal academic credentials except his new Princeton degree, but Andrew
  Eliot, the Harvard Librarian from 1763 to 1767, had few more. Graduated from
  Harvard in 1762, he was appointed butler of the college in June of 1763. In
  September of that year, “for want of some other suitable person” he was made
  Librarian at a salary of six pounds per year. When the new laws for the library
  were adopted in 1765 he was reelected for three years at a salary ten times
  as great.<a
href="#_edn170" name="_ednref170" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>170</span></a>
  Academic salaries in the eighteenth century are puzzling.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Sometimes members of the faculty were
  reimbursed for over­seeing the library, “for assisting the Steward in preserving
  order in the dining room,” and for other college duties by being given free
  meals in the college commons in addition to their regular teaching salaries.
  In the fall of 1787 two “professors” whose regular salaries were £200 and £75
  were authorized by Samuel Stanhope Smith as Vice&#8209;President to receive
  their meals for these additional services.<a href="#_edn171" name="_ednref171" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>171</span></a></span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>John Nelson Abeel received a salary of
  £40 as tutor for each of the two sessions in 1791&#8209;92.<a href="#_edn172" name="_ednref172" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>172</span></a> Presumably when he assumed in addition
  the duties of the Librarian in 1793 he was paid five pounds extra for that service,
  as David English was in 1795. English's accounting with the Treasurer, duly
  audited by John Beatty of the Board of Trustees, survives.<a href="#_edn173" name="_ednref173" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>173</span></a> It shows that he was paid £2&#8209;10&#8209;0
  as Librarian for the session ending in September, 1795 and that he collected
  and turned over to the treasurer £20&#8209;15&#8209;0 in li­brary fees at five
  shillings each from 29 seniors, 27 juniors, 19 soph­omores, and 8 freshmen.
  Three seniors and one sophomore are named as not yet having paid their library
  fees. There seem to be no surviving records to indicate whether the difference
  between the Librarian's honorarium and the total fees collected from students
  was spent for the purchase of books after it was turned over to the treasurer.</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>In general, the circumstances of librarianship
  at Princeton in the eighteenth century correspond rather closely to those that
  prevailed at Harvard throughout the same period and indeed from 1667 to 1877:</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>During the early years of the College Library each library-­keeper
  or librarian held the office for a short time only, usually while he was preparing
  to enter the Christian min­istry…. Of the sixty men whose lives are recorded
  here only five . . . can be said to have made librarianship their pro­fession.
  Of the others twenty&#8209;nine, or over half, became clergymen; seven were
  teachers; six entered the legal and three the medical profession; and the remaining
  ten fol­lowed various pursuits. The average term of office for the whole period
  is three and a half years; but for the first cen­tury (1677&#8209;1777) the
  average was not quite two and one third years.<a href="#_edn174" name="_ednref174" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>174</span></a></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%;
'><span style='font-size:24.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>*</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The story of the Princeton library in
  the eighteenth century that is most clearly documented is the story of the devoted
  efforts of the faculty, trustees, alumni, and friends of the college to build
  a collection of books and philosophical instruments. That the effort was partially
  frustrated bespeaks the physical and economic disruption of the Revolution and
  perhaps the lack of great wealth in the Princeton constituency. That the effort
  was continued in spite of all the difficulties indicates a recognition that
  the library was the central and essential instrument in the kind of teaching
  envisioned by Dickinson and Burr and their successors. There are hints at least
  that this was not merely the rote learning of a few classical texts but an expansive
  kind of teaching involving wide reading, leading to considerable independence
  of thought and the development of skill in writing and speaking.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The Princeton library was intended to
  be a teaching library, available to both “Officers and Students,” as President
  Davies pointed out and later regulations insist. It was placed in the charge
  of teachers who were themselves bookish men. Well&#8209;housed in the very center
  of the building devoted to student living and learning, the library was a symbol
  of the aspirations of a provincial college to reach beyond its colonial status
  and a token of the esteem in which its Presbyterian founders held education.
  It was the heart of the college that visitors were taken to see, and if some
  of them found its beat a weak one after the war, there was always enough vitality
  to nourish recovery.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Of the practical details of library economy
  there are few records, but in general the operating procedures of the Princeton
  library seem to have been not unlike those of the other colonial colleges. These
  procedures were determined not by theory but by the desire to make a few thousand
  cherished books as available as possible while at the same time preserving this
  scarce and hard&#8209;won prop­erty for the next classes of students. The determining
  factors, then as now, were the availability of funds and the perception of priori­ties
  by the faculty and trustees. President Davies may have set an impossible goal
  in wanting his students to “have Bookes always at Hand to consult upon every
  Subject that may occur to them”; but to have a working collection immediately
  available for an hour or two a week under the guidance of a bright young teacher
  and to allow students to borrow books for use outside the library was a start
  in the right direction.</span></p>

    other American college of the eighteenth century seems to have been put into
    print.  The <i>Catalogue of the Library of Yale College</i> (1743) has a preface
    by President Clap, who compiled it, but his comments are limited to an explanation
    of the classification system and a commendation of Samuel Johnson’s <i>Introduction
    to the Study of Philosophy </i>as a guide to study.  Johnson, a Yale graduate,
    had written an outline of universal knowledge, with recommended books in each
    category, and an edition of this work was printed in 1743 apparently to accompany
    the Yale catalogue (<i>A Catalogue of the Library of Yale College </i>[New
    London:  T. Green, 1743] and Samuel Johnson [1696-1772], <i>An Introduction
    to the Study of Philosophy </i>[New London:  T. Green, 1743]).  Useful though
    these two publications must have been, they contain nothing remotely like
    President Davies’ statement of educational and library philosophy.  The other
    college library catalogues of the century were published by Harvard (1723,
    1725, 1735, 1773, 1790), Yale (1755, 1791), Brown (1793), and Williams (1794).
    They contain no general statements of the utility and importance of the library
    in the educational process.  See Jim Ranz, <i>The Printed Book Catalogue in
    American Libraries:  1723-1900.  </i>ACRL Monograph #26.  (Chicago:  American
    Library Association, 1964).</p>

  <p class=MsoEndnoteText><span>            </span>A teasing echo in phrasing
    occurs in the first sentence of Davies’ introduction when he speaks of the
    library as “the most ornamental and useful furniture of a college.”  Thirty
    years before, in a plea for funds for the library of the College of William
    and Mary, Professor William Dawson had written to Chancellor Edmund Gibson,
    Bishop of London, in a letter dated August 11, 1729:  “In short, my Lord,
    the whole is only not compleat for want of the most useful and ornamental
    Furniture, Books.”  (Quoted in John M. Jennings, <i>The Library of the College
    of William and Mary in Virginia, 1693-1793</i>  [Charlottesville:  The University
    Press of Virginia, 1968], pp. 43-44.)  Davies was of course in Virginia from
    1747 to 1759, and he was undoubtedly often in Williamsburg, where his wife’s
    brother was associated with the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> and where her father
    had been mayor.  Did he there hear or see Dawson’s rather striking phrase
    used?  Good fund-raising slogans do not die easily.  Or did both men draw
    upon some common published source?</p>

    have chosen not to attempt to explain the feud between the New Lights and
    the Old Lights, a product of the Great Awakening, although the schism was
    a considerable factor in the founding of the college and perhaps for a while
    in its educational philosophy. Readers with only a marginal interest in theology
    might find such an explanation too heavy a burden in a narrative already of
    necessity heavily laden with theological matters. The story is told in many
    places, Wertenbaker's <i>Princeton</i>, for ex­ample. Henry F. May, in <i>The
    Enlightenment in America</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1976), pp.
    49&#8209;65, explains in a broader context how Princeton became “the center
    of con­troversy and the defensive stronghold of American Calvinism.” Douglas
    Sloan in <i>The Scottish Enlightenment and the American College Ideal</i>
    (New York: Teachers College Press, 1971), pp. 43­-58, describes how the theological
    views of the New Side, as it was sometimes called, led to the founding of
    Princeton.</span></p>

    the important point that Prince­ton's circumstances and charter were in fact

    This clause was “the first such statement of tolerant principles in an American
    college charter…. But the fact of pri­mary significance is that with Princeton
    we have the first instance of a college founded under the characteristic conditions
    of the America of the eighteenth, rather than the seventeenth, century: religious
    and ethnic heterogeneity, schismatic differences brought by the Awakening,
    and growing mutual accommodation and tolerance.” (Richard Hofstadter and Robert

    in Manuscripts Division, Princeton University Library of ALS No. 155 in Doddridge
    Correspondence, Volume 4, in the Library of New College, London. Professor
    Horton Davies has pointed out to me that the idea of a dissenting divine having
    influence at Court was not necessarily wishful thinking on the part of Burr.
    There had been since 1732 an unofficial but</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rather effective
    mechanism through which the dissenting view could be presented at Court and
    in Parliament. The &quot;Protestant Dissenting Deputies&quot; consisted and
    still consist of two members chosen from each congregation of Presbyterians,
    Baptists, and Independents within ten (later twelve) miles of London. Acting
    principally through a &quot;Committee of Twenty&#8209;one,&quot; the Deputies
    constituted at first a skillful lobby for the repeal of the Test and Corporation
    Acts and a sort of ACLU ready to react vigorously to particular acts of persecution
    against dissenters. The story of this organization is told in Bernard Lord
    Manning, The Protestant Dissenting Deputies (Cambridge: Cambridge University
    Press, 1952). &quot;For a large part of their history,&quot; says Manning,
    &quot;the conduct of the national campaign for the relief of Dissenters re­mained
    in the hands of this committee of London lawyers and merchants; indeed, in
    the 18th century they might almost have been called ambassadors of international
    Nonconformity to the Court of St James&quot; (p. 16).</span></p>

  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The Deputies
    acquired a special role for the colonies, acting as &quot;an unofficial legation
    for those American Colonies which derived from the Puritan exiles. Advice
    was asked and given on the most trivial as well as the weightiest matters
    which had any connection with religion; the Deputies were a regular channel
    of approach to the King and Court, and Colonial Governors cor­responded with
    them and received their encouragement, and sometimes their admonitions&quot;
    (p. 407). While it is not clear that Burr's appeal to Doddridge in 1749 to
    block the possible appoint­ment of justice Morris as governor was channelled
    through the Deputies, asimilar appeal in 1756 received their support and the
    assurance from Lord Halifax &quot;that the person the Colony feared would
    be made Governor of New Jersey was not at present thought of.&quot; (Minutes
    of the Protestant Dissenting Deputies, 29 Septem­ber, 1756; quoted in Manning,
    Protestant Dissenting Deputies, P. 4o8.)</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Samuel Davies
    appeared before the Committee on his British trip in 1754 to seek its endorsement
    of his fund raising for the college and its assistance in drafting and forwarding
    a petition to the King concerning the licensing of dissenting ministers in
    Virginia. The Committee refused to become involved in appeals for money, as
    it was later to do again when Harvard sought help in 1764 after the library
    fire, but it did use its influence on the licensing problem in Virginia. (Manning,
    Protestant Dissenting Deputies, pp. 4og&#8209;lo.)</span></p>

    in <i>Academic Freedom</i>, p. 152, writes, &quot;Princeton, summing up its
    own virtues for the public in 1764 was only re­peating claims that had grown
    common among the other colleges when it asserted that its students were encouraged
    to exercise the right of private judgment and that the faculty did not dictate
    to them with ‘an air of infallibility.’” One wonders whether the evidence
    justifies quite such a sweeping generalization. In any event, our concern
    here is with the application of these concepts of intellectual freedom to
    teaching methods and, more specifically, to the involvement of the library
    in the teaching process. This combination of ideas as expressed by Davies
    and Blair is far from common in eighteenth&#8209;century America. It does
    appear, or at least the library role is hinted at, in what Hofstadter calls
    “probably the most remarkable statement in pre&#8209;Revolutionary educational
    discussions.” In 1753, William Livingstone published a plea for making the
    proposed King's College a liberal, non­sectarian institution. Among other
    college rules he proposed &quot;that the officers and collegians have an unrestrained
    access to all books in the library, and that free conversation upon polemical
    and con­troverted points in divinity be not discountenanced, whilst all public
    disputations upon the various tenets of different professions of Protestants
    be absolutely forbidden.&quot; (Quoted in Hofstadter and Metzger, <i>Academic
    Freedom</i>, p. 191.) Lest library access for students be taken for granted,
    it may be noted that the library of the College of William and Mary, founded
    in 1693, was not opened to undergraduates until 1779 (John M. Jennings, <i>The
    Library of the College of William and Mary in Virginia</i>, 1693&#8209;1793
    [Charlottesville: The University Press of Virginia, 1968], pp. 70&#8209;71).</span></p>

    would be satisfying to claim a direct influence of Davies on that other great
    Virginian advocate of religious freedom, James Madison, but the living reputation
    of Davies is the only possible channel of transmission. Madison entered Princeton
    as a student in 1769, about eight years after the death of Davies. But there
    was a connection. Irving Brant writes:</span></p>

  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Of the two Princeton graduates, both
    Anglicans, who advised</span>
Madison to go there, the elder, Alexander Martin,
    made a public record as a defender of dissenters.
    As Governor of North Carolina he insisted that even
    the much&#8209;condemned “enthusiasts” be included in a law making
    support of gospel ministers a charge upon the state revenues.
    The younger brother, Thomas Martin, entered Princeton
    near the close of the presidency of Dr. Samuel Davies,
    whose fame rested on his defense of the rights of nonconformists
    in Virginia, and he pursued his studies under President
    Samuel Finley, who had been arrested, convicted of vagrancy
    and driven out of Connecticut for preaching in an unlicensed
    pulpit. Many Anglicans graduated at Princeton, but
    their background was one of hostility to church establishment.

    of this is relevant to the immediate point, I have quoted the entire paragraph

    approaching genuine religious freedom.</span></p>

  <p>The wide geographical
    dispersal of the alumni accounts in some measure
    for their extraordinary role in the public affairs of their time.
    By the end of 1775, 279~ men in this volume were still living.
    Of these only 8 (3 per cent) became Loyalists, in contrast to
    Harvard, where 196 (16 perfect) of the 1,224 alumni living in 1775 took the British
    side during the Revolution. All told, 8 8 of the Princeton alumni assumed
    some office of military responsibility during the War for Independence, in­cluding
    the 35 who served as chaplains. No less than g of the 55 members of the Constitutional
    Convention of 1787 had graduated from Nassau Hall, and these 9 represented
    six dif­ferent states. Five of the members of the Convention are found in
    this volume. In addition, this volume includes 21 men who served in the Continental
    Congress, 4 who lived to become members of the United States Senate, 7 who
    served in the House of Representatives, and 2 who became justices of the United
    States Supreme Court, one of them a Chief Justice. The contribution to leadership
    at the state and local levels of government was comparably impressive. Two
    alumni be­came the governors of their respective states, and more than 40
    served on their state legislatures. Five men served as state attorney&#8209;general,
    three of them being the first to hold the office. Over one&#8209;third of
    the alumni at some time or other held public office, a figure including very
    few of the 158 who became clergymen. (James McLachlan, Princetonians, 1746

    replacement of Latin by English as the medium of instruction is often regarded
    as one of the major achievements of the academies. This movement began in
    some of the earliest academies, but it is difficult to say at what point it
    became gen­eral. There would presumably be a good many transitional stages.
    Certainly Latin was still used to a considerable extent well on in the eighteenth
    century. To what extent may the academies have been stimulated to this change,
    or at any rate encouraged to it, by Scottish university example? The credit
    for the development at Glasgow is usually given to Hutcheson, who became Professor
    of Moral Philosophy in 1729. But the way had been paved long before .... On
    the other hand, Latin was the language of lectures in Physic at Edinburgh
    in i74o . . . . It is thus difficult to go further than that the introduction
    of English as the teaching medium of the academies probably owed something
    to Scottish influence.&quot; (Smith, Birth of Modern Education, p. 70.)</span></p>

    Stiles'srevelation that there was a dramatic performance after prayers is
    interesting in view of John Witherspoon's well­known aversion to the theater

    and Efects of the Stage; being an Attempt to Show that Contributing to the
    Support ofa Public Theatre is Inconsistent with the Character of a Christian
    (Glasgow: J.Bryce and D.Paterson,1757).) Perhaps this is another pedagogi­cal
    device that Burr borrowed from the Dissenting Academies. Joseph Priestley
    writes, &quot;Finding no public exercises at Warring­ton, I introduced them
    there, so that afterwards every Saturday the tutors, all the students, and
    often strangers, were assembled to hear English and Latin compositions, and
    sometimes, to hear the delivery of speeches, and the exhibition of scenes
    of plays&quot; (A uto­biography, p. 88). J. W. Ashley Smith, in the Birth
    of Modern Education, says, &quot;Nevertheless the earliest tutors&#8209;such
    as Henry and N ewcome&#8209;had no objection at all to dramatics, and in John
    Jennings' Academy Tamerlane was performed by the pupils. This was one respect

    it seems to have consisted of two large boxes of books, and sundry other things
    which the president shipped by water to New Brunswick, whence they were carted
    to Princeton&quot; (Princeton, p. 40). But there is a problem here. The entry

    is that this entry is clearly dated November lo, 1755, just a year before
    the move of the college, and appears in proper sequence for that year. President
    Burr's accounts often gave him and the Trustees difficulty, but it is hard
    to believe that he mis­dated the entries for an entire year. Perhaps those
    two large boxes, instead of containing the college library, contained the
    library of Governor Belcher, inventoried in Elizabeth on May 7, 1755 and accepted
    by the Trustees as a gift at their meeting of September 24, 1755 It seems
    reasonable to surmise that at that time the deci­sion was made to send the

    matter of the &quot;lecture method&quot; is so closely related to use of the
    library that it deserves a note. Ashbel Green, first a stu­dent, then a faculty
    colleague of Witherspoon, writes: The method of
    teaching by lecture was never in use in this college till
    it was introduced by Dr. Witherspoon.... Every improvement
    is in danger of running to an extreme. That in&#8209;struction by
    lecture has many advantages is readily admitted: E. and yet it appears
    to the writer more than questionable, whether young persons, wholly ignorant
    of a given subject, will acquire a competent knowledge of it, by once or twice
    hearing lectures on it, unless they have it also in their power to review
    and con over what they have heard, in a manuscript, or in a printed book.
    (Witherspoon, pp. 125&#8209;26)</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Green then goes
    on to describe Witherspoon's technique of having every student make a copy
    of the basic lecture or syllabus upon which the lecturer would then elaborate
    in the classroom. &quot;It thus appears,&quot; he continues, &quot;that the
    method of instruction adopted by Dr. Witherspoon, embraced all the advantages
    of lecturing in connection with the aid of a book or manuscript&#8209;both
    furnished by himself.&quot; This procedure may have satisfied Ashbel Green's
    doubts about the famous Doctor's pedagogy, but it stillseems not quite up
    to the ideal of encouraging students to go to the library and &quot;expatiate
    at large thro' the boundless and variegated Fields of Science.&quot; Yet Dr.
    Witherspoon clearly understood the impor­tance of libraries, not only as an
    aid in teaching but also in the higher levels of research. &quot; N othing,&quot;
    he declared, &quot;was holding America back in point of general knowledge

    a scholar had to be very widely read: &quot; On the subject of literature

    them thoroughly, together with the frequent exercise of reflection, will make

    Yale in 1745 codified a variation of the library fee, really a rental fee:
    six pence per month for a folio, four pence for a quarto, and three pence
    for an octavo or &quot;a lesser book.&quot; At William and Mary the fee at

    Witherspoon to David Witherspoon, March 17, 1777. Witherspoon Collection,
    Manuscripts Division, Library of Congress. Ac. 2637. It is not clear how Witherspoon's
    personal library escaped as the troops poured through Princeton 'in the preceding
    December and January. The books were presumably in the President's House,
    a stone's throw from Nassau Hall, for Witherspoon was not yet living at &quot;Tusculum,&quot;
    the farmhouse which he had built in 1773 a mile north of the town. Perhaps
    the officers who undoubtedly took over the President's House as one of the
    finest houses in the town had more respect for books than most of the soldiers
    who were quartered in Nassau Hall. At any rate the Doctor's library survived.
    Passed on to his son&#8209;in&#8209;law Samuel Stanhope Smith, it was purchased
    with Smith's library in 1812, and now rests in the reconstructed eighteenth&#8209;century
    library at the entrance to the Rare Books and Special Collections division
    of Firestone Library. The Harvard College Library might have suffered the
    same fate as that at Princeton had not the Provincial Congress voted on June
    15, 1775, that it be moved to Andover, and later to Concord, when the college
    buildings were occupied by the Continental army (Alfred Claghorn Potter and
    Charles Knowles Bolton, The Librarians of Harvard College, 1667&#8209;1887,
    `Harvard University Library Bibliographical Contributions,' No. 52, (Cambridge,
    Mass.: Library of Harvard University, 18971, p. 30).</span></p>

    cannot help contrasting the response and the speed of rebuilding the libraries
    at Harvard and at Princeton, both de­stroyed at approximately the same time.
    In 1764 the Harvard library was destroyed by fire, with the loss of all but
    404 of its approximately 5ooo books. The response of its benefactors was such
    that in spite of the disruption of the Revolution the catalogue of 1790 listed
    about 13,000 volumes. After Princeton's disaster in the Revolution, when about
    2ooo volumes were lost and only a few survived, the library was rebuilt to
    only about 3000 volumes by the end of the century. The difference in these
    rates of regrowth cannot be accounted for by a difference in effort, for Princeton
    could hardly have tried more diligently, at least until the death of Witherspoon.
    Perhaps the difference lies in the relatively greater size and wealth of the
    Harvard constituency, a factor, in part, of the age of the institution.</span></p>

    The petition appears in full in the Trustees Minutes for April 13, 1796, as
    a part of the report of the committee. The report is printed in Maclean, History
    of the College of New Jersey, II, i3&#8209;i6. As the report indicates, the
    grant was made upon the promise of some of the Trustees that the college would
    be liberated some­what from Presbyterian control, and indeed the next two
    Trustees to be elected were Episcopalians. In spite of this, the grant was
    unpopular in the state. All of those who voted for it were turned out in the
    next election, the grant was never repeated, and Princeton remained a private
    institution. President Maclean's discussion in 1877 of the whole episode is
    interesting because it reveals the attitude of a later generation of Princetonians

    college in 1774 occurs this statement, which must have caused a row: &quot;But
    they must here observe, that understanding this Board did not conceive itself
    justifiable in the application of the College Funds to any other uses, than
    the necessary purposes of the Institution, to which they are at present very
    inadequate; the Committee therefore, in this state of the Account, have not
